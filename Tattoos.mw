So, I've been thinking about getting a tattoo for a while.  Basically my idea was this: In the old testament God told the israelites over and over to build a rock of remembarance for various things, and they were in places that were both important and common.  This way, every time someone walked by the big pile of rocks they would remember what God had done for them, and where they had come from.  

However, I'm planning on moving around quite a bit, so building a pile of rocks is a fairly ethereal portion of my life.  I mean for instance after building the lounge loft, everytime I saw it, it reminded me how important the floor was to me, and I saw it every day.  

Also, I know that since high school sharpie on my arm is about the only way I can keep things in the forefront of my mind.  Because it's not just a reminder, it's a very present and oft seen reminder.  

So here is my idea;  I consistently go through important portions of life, and probably will up until I die.  I mean my home, parents, outdoors, camp experience, LU experience, have all had important and varied contributions to my life.  I was thinking it would be pretty sweet to get a tattoo, probably somewhere that I would see it regularly, that was a pile of rocks (stylized of course to look awesome).  I would then put an icon in each of them, to remind me of something.  The cornerstone would be Christ, one for the Becci, one for Oregon, one for my parents, one for FLOODERS, etc.  Then as I continue to grow in Christ and life, I can add rocks to the pile continuing to remind me where I came from and what is important to me.  Anyways, what do you guys think?  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 17:16, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

I'm opposed to tattoos just because I'll change shape over time and they'll look different later on in life.

Dr. Mason spoke at chapel a few semesters back about the idea of having an ebenezer (http://www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/_Student-Life/spiritual-life/chapel/Spring2008/mp3/2008-04-09-Steve-Mason.mp3 I did a quick spot check, and heard him talking about it a little over 3/4 of the way in).  He actually had stones rather than tattooing himself.  I don't know if you can tell from the audio or not, but I think he had people bringing them out on the stage and piling them up.  Getting a tattoo would mean you'd have more space in the bric-a-brac cabinet though...

I think it's a good idea, especially your specific image idea, but I think ManHawk has a good practical point.  You'd want to make the stones iconic enough that they will always be clear and in a place where they won't turn to wrinkle-sauce. --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 05:10, 1 June 2009 (UTC)


Here's one thing to think about: would you ever want to do missions in a place where having a tattoo--especially a tattoo that obviously identifies you as a Christian--would be a problem? --[[User:Fjord|Fjord]] 11:45, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

It's been too long since I saw a dinosaur comic... I kinda think it's a sweet idea (we've talked about this before), but I'm still undecided (on my personal stance for ME getting a tattoo, but I have no intentions of getting one).  I also like the C4 tattoo wedding ring idea.  But, the other guys have some legit points.  30 years down the road the flooder symbol might read something else in a different language or something (not that I think you're going to get super fat or anything).  I guess it doesn't currently bother me, especially considering the purpose, but it might bother others from a "Biblical" (not an accurate reading in context of the Bible as a whole) perspective.  The law says not to get tatoos(Lev 19:28), but I don't think this really applies.  I think it goes back to looking at the breakdown of the law into moral law (10 Commandments), sacrificial law, and civil law (to which Lev 19 falls into).  Without getting too deep into it, I don't think the stuff in the civil law directly applies to us today, although the concepts do.  Apparetly this verse (I'm using an internet source...) dealt with some pagan practice.  So, if you're wanting to like attract attention to yourself or fit in I don't think it's good, but if getting a tattoo is glorifying to God (legitiamately, which I believe your intentions are), then I think it's fine.

Fjord, You bring up what I think is an interesting philisophical point, as in should we worry about people knowing we are christians?  Practically, this seems like a really good idea, like for stealth bible smuggling and such, but theoretically should it matter?  I don't have a particularly good answer right now, but I did think about that, and kinda came to the conclusion that providing it wasn't overtly obnoxious then I probably wouldn't worry about it. I think God takes care of His followers, so would He let small tattoo for his glory prevent me from serving him?  Anyways, I also thought about the wrinkly thing.. and my thoughts were to just make it both somewhere, and of something that they would still be identifiable to me long after I loose my svelt figure.  Plus, I since only I need to know what they mean, I could have pretty obscure icons and I would still get it. Eh...  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 18:08, 1 June 2009 (UTC)


Hey Goat, I like the purpose, the inspiration and the imagery you expressed (though I'm not quite sure about its appearance as a tattoo). I completely agree that it is important to have the reminders ever before you and it's a neat thought. 

I'm not convinced there is a right or wrong in regard to tattoos as a whole, and they don't bother me but there are a few things I believe every individual should consider which I would like to throw your way. 

I believe they can be a great asset as you live and share your faith, in reaching out to others, especially certain groups. But as it is permanent and an action with the body you have been given in this life, which will be recognized by those you come in contact with, I would exhort you not to make the decision lightly and take it before your Maker as your life is His. God has blessed you with a an incredible woman at your side, listen to her, value her opinions and input in relation to the idea as a whole and on you specifically. Remember your body is her body and she should have some say in what she looks at the rest of her life. :) (1 Corinthians 7:4) 
Though the future is unknown it is important to consider future ministry (as was mentioned). Again something to pray over, could having it hinder later work? God is more than able to protect you physically but God has given us free will. Could this hinder your ministry to others either in another country where tattoos are offensive or even to those here, believers or unbelievers. (1 Timothy 4:12 ". . . be an example to believers in word, in conduct, in love in spirit, in faith, in purity.") Would it be a stubbing block for those God has placed in your life? 

Not trying to dissuade you from the idea, like I said I honestly believe it can be a huge asset and something God can use to reach people but He has called each person individually and I don't know where He is leading or directing you in your pursuit of Him. As it is a permanent decision, as minor as it may seem, it can have a significant impact in your life wherever the Lord leads you. 

Just a few thoughts. LisaMichelle 02:48, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
