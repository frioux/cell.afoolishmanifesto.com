So becci and I were talking about finances the other night, and standard of living and all of that stuff.  We came to a few interesting conclusions.  First, we can live pretty cheap and pretty comfortable, I mean for instance, with rounded values and approximated values:

My earning power in grad school:  1600 per month
Becci's earning power at a job:   4000 per month  (currently unemployed but in general) 

Total House income:  circa 5500 Per month

K, various bills; rent, internet, power, laundry, water, garbage: 900 per month
Insurance:  900 per year (cars) 
Health insurance:  150 per month
Groceries:  300 per month

Total bills:  about 1500 per month

Total Disposable income:  4000

Now, figure in payments for debt of 1000 dollars a month (student loans, credit card debt from wedding, and miscellaneous) and chuck in another 1000 for incidentals and savings... still 2000 dollars a month..

Now I realize that at somepoint my truck will actually die, and will need to be replaced, and I also realize that health stuff comes up, and ya know.. whatever.. stuff comes up.. but heres the kicker: This would give us an incredibly comfortable life with cash to spare.  I mean we could scale our lifestyle to take advantage of the money, but why?  The reason I was thinking about this is because all of us for the most part are young, relatively debt free ( I know school debts but they're minor) and for the most part high earners.  
What do we do with this money is my question.  At LU people often mention about how RG donated 90% of his income to God, and kept 10%, so if becci and I donated our extra, it would be like 35% and when I get out of school and get a job, it'd be more like 50%.  Of course kids will come eventually and all that stuff, but this is kinda hardcore.  
Becci and I were thinking it would be awesome to set up a budget to give away like 1000 a month, so have the tithe for your church, and then you could support missionaries, have personal missions (I was thinking I could supply the church with fresh roasted coffee) sponsor the youth group, college scholarships, whatever.. 
What do you guys think.  Currently this is all a pipe dream for becci and I because she's still unemployed but still, we're discovering how little it costs to live and live comfortably, and what you could do with the rest.  Let me know what you think.

Well, you guys seem like you are more awesome than me.  I have had trouble living with the same comfort as you guys with my money (I am trying to save %50 of it for paying off loans) and a big part of it is how expensive food is.  I find that 450 is closer to what I pay a month.  I haven't quite settled down though, so that may change after I get used to living and stuff.

I'd say that if you guys can pull that off it would be totally awesome, but I personally have had trouble keeping costs down.  That also has something to do with gas and driving to Greenville once a week (120 miles round trip~) and all things girlfriend related.

So, current living expenses $0, current savings $0, current money in the bank ~$0.  So, I'm obviously not quite in the same boat as you guys, but I have been thinking seriously about financial issues since a little before the summer.  I agree with you GOAT.  I think if we are very intentional about our $$, then we can live comfortable lives and still do a ton of good.  I think that for some reason conservative Christians have got in there mind that it is a shameful thing to live well (a whole other discussion), but I don't see that as a Biblical principle.  I think that God calls us to be good stewards of what we have been given, and I also see more and more the necessity of helping others every chance that we get (PS, roasting coffee for church has also been on my mind).  We see that tithe (10%) is an Old Testament standard, but we see people giving above and beyond that in the New Testament.  I think that we should all be generous and willing to give, but I think ultimately the amounts/uses come down to where God is leading.  For example, I can help out the guys on the floor here and there, but I can't start a gnarly school like RG. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 20:08, 7 October 2008 (UTC)


Frew, I'm sure costs will come down after you get more settled in, I mean for instance with food, how often do you buy a bag of flour or sugar, just once a year.. and once you have furniture, you have it.  And another perk for you guys to look forward to, is that feeding two people costs about as much as feeding one person due to the effects of bulk purchases.  Also, if you live in a place that is economically depressed, housing is cheap, and if you walk to work cut even more money out.  Finally, once you're married you're in the same boat as your wife, so it's easier to live more cheaply because she realizes how much money/debt you have collectively.  It's about the only thing I've found to make becci want to buy less stuff.  
Yeah I guess one of the things Becci and I have been talking about is how to be wise with our money.  For instance, saving a portion of your excess is a wise thing to do.  However, saving all of your excess is probably lack of faith.  Dr. Graff says that money is for spending, and I agree, while it's wise to put a little money away, giving money away to God will bring dividends and if you are giving your money to Him I'm positive he'll take care of you.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 11:48, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

So I thought it was only fair to update this post oh.. four months later... So as an update, when we got to Troy, we figured becci would have a job very quickly and soon after we'd be rolling in the dough... Turns out finding a job in a worldwide economic depression is rather difficult.  So I thought it would be worthwhile updating the idea of using money for God.  When I was in college I had very little, and needed very little, so it wasn't a big deal to rely on God because my debts (non-school) were minimal, and my needs were minimal.  However, upon graduation and moving to new york my debts and needs were significantly moreso.. And initlaly we were really planning (read relying) on the earning power of both becci and I.  We discovered rapidly that our plans weren't meant to be.  So for the past four months we've been living from pay check to pay check.  And to be honest it's been a mixed blessing.  We haven't been able to do much fun stuff, we haven't been able to  spend all the money we'd like and in general we've been pretty poor.  But I think something that this has taught us is that God is faithful to provide enough, it may not be enough to live like we'd like.. but it's enough.  While it's a little stressful, we're both learning to trust and relax and allow God to take care of us.  Maybe it's a good thing to be a poor married couple for a little while.  Worth considering.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 20:05, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
