I've been reading this book called "The Gospel in a Pluralist Society," by Lesslie Newbigin, and it's been pretty freaking rad.  The basic premise of the book is how culture, the gospel and the church all relate, and it's a pretty dense converstaion on these topics.  I recently had an epiphany on how I would share the gospel now, vs how I would share it before I read this book, and I call it the Harry Potter metaphor, if you haven't read the series, you could potentially shift it to a different series, but I think because harry potter is so pervasive in our culture it probably works best.  First I'll give the basis of the book so far (I'm not done yet, I'm reading it for Theology at the taproom) and then i'll establish the metaphor, and it think it's pretty freaking cool.

So, in the book Newbigin addresses a few major things, first off, he starts out by addressing what could be called Modernism (scientific thought etc. )  He calls this a plausibility structure, and says that all societies have them, and at different times/places etc they are different.  For instance at one point in time all people just "knew" that the earth was the center of the universe and so they would never question such a thing, it was within their plausibility structure.  And this idea demonstrates that to doubt something you must first have faith in something else.  For instance if you tell me that you have a perpetual motion machine i would doubt that because I konw about the laws of thermodynamics.  If I didn't know about them, it could sound much more plausible, but because I have faith that the laws of thermodynamics are true I doubt you actual have a perpetual motion device.  This idea is observable in children because they don't know/believe much and thus are gullible, you can convince them of things that aren't true because "they don't konw any better."  Also, this requires that at some point you have decided to believe in something.  Our current western society believes in science because Descartes says "I think, therefore I am."  So we believe the world is rational and that repeatability (science) is proof of truth.  This is inherently circular reasoning, but we all as a society accept it and thus the plasibility structure is established.  This idea will be presented in the metaphor.

Another idea present in the book is the idea of the Bible as true history.  I have said (stolen from a history Prof) that history is less about what, and more about who told you.  Currently, historians view history from a national/political viewpoint.  You could view history from all kinds of viewpoints, from the viewpoint of the progression of food, scientific progression, all kinds of things.  But the bible is the history of the world, from the viewponit of what is important about what God has revealed to us, and what is important in the story between us and Him.  Thusly, the bible may not note what was going on in China at 2000bc, but this is no more wierd than me not knowing what Napoleon ate before the battle of waterloo.  Thusly, we can look at the bible as a record of the important stuff to place ourselves in the context of history, it may not be complete, but it is what God deemed necessary for us to accurately live, love, and follow Him.

The final point (so far) that Newbigin has made is the concept of election.  He doesn't really come at it from a calvinistic/armenianism viewpoint, rather he says that often in the bible God mentions choosing us and not choosing other people.  We have (in the context of our plausibility structure)come of with different mechanisms/explanations for this idea, but really in the end, God has revealed himself to us. The idea that there is some truth that can be discovered by rational people on earth that totally proves God is an artifact of our current plausibility structure, and really only God can reveal himself to us and not us discover God.  We are chosen, like it or not.  This too will make it into the metaphor.  

Rational for the metaphor:  I couldn't figure out a good way to talk to non-believers about these ideas, and really, they changed the way that I wanted to discuss the gospel, so I decided to look for examples where similar ideas were already present in our culture.  And came to the harry potter metaphor....

The metaphor:  So, in reading the harry potter series we discover a distinct difference in the world view of the wizards and the muggles.  They have lived in the same world, for the same time period and often observed the same things.  However, what they see of often very different.  Wizards are people who have magical powers, they are born this way and have no choice in the matter, and because of this they are very different than muggles.  In the muggle world people discover aspects of science to help them through their day, escalators, electricity, cars, but in the magical world people use magical means to accomplish the same goals.  Both muggles and wizards may look at the planets but muggles see balls of rocks and wizards see magical processes.  When muggles hear about someone dying in the mountains they put it down to a climbing accident and wizards put it down to giants.  When muggles read their history they see the wars between germany and france and wizards see vampires attacking goblins.  Muggles consider the world to be rational and use logic and science to determine the roots of cause and effect while wizards look for magical stimuli.  Same world, different plausibility structure, same actions, different importance, similar history, very different values.  And especially in the cases of people who switch from the muggle world to the magical world it is a complete paradigm shift, things are totally different when magic happens.  

Generally as a society I think you'll find that people believe it to be plausible to set up an alternate society that is hidden/different from the one people live in.  And in reality that is much what the Christian world is.  The things that really matter to us are very different from the world, the way we view history is decidedly different, the way we determine truth is different, etc. etc.  However, this doesn't make us arrogant to say this, rather honest.  Obviously this doesn't mean we should be jerks to people, but it does mean we don't need to rationalize/logically prove our actions, because that is the worlds plausibility structure, not ours.  There is nothing plausible to the world about miracles, but we know as christians they do happen.  

I think in retrospect this post may be difficult to understand, but post some questions and I'll try to clarify, also read the book, it's on of my favorites so far.
