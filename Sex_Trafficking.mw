In the past few months, I've been looking into the an organization called Shared Hope International. Their purpose is to fight sex trafficking and the
victimization of people for prositution and pornography across the globe. The effort started in India, but has spread to other countries, and there is a big focus in the US now, where over 100,000 minors are trafficked for commercial sex.

This was some new information for me, and I've been trying to see how I can help fight this problem. Is this something you guys have heard about before? --Benjie


You might remember a speaker at LU from Love146  which is another group that is very similar.  He spoke during chapel once and it must have been before my super senior year because I remember actually being at it, and they were all about stopping sex trafficking of minors by raising awareness of the problem.  At LU I never heard anything else about it, it was one of those very interesting chapels that I think most of the people there missed how real it was because we are pretty oblivious in the USA.  However at the church I'm going to now they are working directly with this organization to raise money and awareness to stop this problem and are trying to mobilize people around it.  I am not personaly involved in any of their work but we just sent one of our pastors over seas to get a ground level look at it and he toured a few countries, (his blog: http://www.terranovachurch.org/blog/archive/ ,just read the april "Miller Trip Updates")  and it was pretty horrific.  From what I understand there are more slaves (most children and sex related) right now than have ever been.  And in some places exploitation and sex slavery affects 80-90% of the children.  Anyways, I"m not sure what I can do personally, but yeah benji I'm hearing what your saying.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 21:59, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
