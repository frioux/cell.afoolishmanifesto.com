In the past few months, I've been looking into the an organization called Shared Hope International. Their purpose is to fight sex trafficking and the
victimization of people for prositution and pornography across the globe. The effort started in India, but has spread to other countries, and there is a big focus in the US now, where over 100,000 minors are trafficked for commercial sex.

This was some new information for me, and I've been trying to see how I can help fight this problem. Is this something you guys have heard about before? --Benjie
