<big>'''Welcome'''</big>


Hey all,
Welcome to the group devotional/bible study wiki, you were probably invited by Frew, Sparky, or I (goat) to join up and share insights on scripture, God, and life.  At this point I don't think any of us know where this is headed or how it will continue.  It could become a "friend authored" biblical commentary with application notes, it could become a book o' miracles like sight with stories of God's work in our lives, or it could fizzle up and die.  Anyways please participate and submit stuff.  The body of Christ is people, and we need input from others.  We all have different perspectives and all are valuable.  At some point we should probably codify this a little more but until then, be awesome.  Charis kai eirene.  ~Goat
