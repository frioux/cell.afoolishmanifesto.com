What do you guys think about reputation?

I've been reading this book Radical Reformission by Mark Driscoll (it's the pneuma video guy) and the first chapter and introduction is mostly about the fact that in a lot of ways the church is addicted to morality and not only morality but protecting it's reputation.  For instance (in general not specific (Think LeTourneau culture)) it is kinda awkward for a christian to be in a bar, and you'd kinda think twice about going to a liqour store if your pastor was with you.  Or if you had a gay friend, introducing thme to your christian friends would be awkward.  Or dating a girl who has a kid from a teenage pregnancy.  The list of "sins" we as christians are supposed to avoid is really long.  But we're not only supposed to avoiid them, we're supposed to avoidi the company of people who commit them, and this isn't because we may get "contaminated" (though some churches would say so) but because it might give people a poor representation of christ, i mean ruin the churches reputation by hanging around sinners...

But heres the rub, Jesus had an awful reputation, glutton, drunkard, lover of sinners and in general a disreputable dood.  I realize that there are some practical issues with guys hanging around prostitutes and strippers all the time, or spending tons of your time with drug dealers, or even talking with arabs about middle eastern politics and religion.  And I concede that paul mentions deacons have to be above reproach and this sort of thing... but whats the deal!  I understand the concept that the more your focused on Jesus the less you need to focus on sin because you're following the truth vs avoiding following lies, but why the heck do we (generally here guys not personally) care what people think about us hanging out with sinners, or drinking alchohol, or going to raves, or whatever.. And how do we correlate this with "not ruining our witness."  

If it's not obvious, I'm pretty frustrated here, from stuff unrelated to reputation, but currently I'm kinda funneling my frustration and anger into the issue.  What do you guys think...--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:38, 16 October 2008 (UTC)


Good calls (I'm still at LU, and still around some of that stuff).  A few verses came to mind immediately.  First, Jesus did hang out with the sinners and was a doctor to the sick (mt 9:12-13).  Also (I'm fascinated with descriptions of the early church; I'm writing an exegesis on it), If you look at Acts 2:42-47 you see that the first believers were together, and "had favor with all people."  Tensions rose though.  Look at the dudes like Peter, John, and Paul  They were carrying the gospel to the ends of the world (Acts 1:8, Matt 28:19-20).  THis pissed people off, and they kept being jailed, whipped, etc.  They did end up recieving a bad reputation, especially with the religious authorities.  This is gnarls, "We ought to obey God rather than man" (Acts 5:29b) was their response.  

I believe that, obviously, our reputations are important, but I believe a good reputation is a byproduct, not a focus.  You cited Timothy for being of good character.  The purpose of Paul's instruction there is for Timothy to be able to have somewhat of a standard for picking church leaders.  I think a good way to tell a good person is there reputation (tree/fruit) among believers AND secular society.  Also, you can usually tell when someone is focussed on their reputation, not God.  I think that we need to follow the spirit, wherever he leads, and not worry about our reputation.  Again in Acts, you see Phillip approach a Eunich (an unwhole man), Paul bring uncorcuimszed men into the temple, and Peter piss of James and the Jerusalm church (still strict in a Jewish legalistic sense) for going to Antioch an chillin' with unkosher Christians.  But on the other hand, Paul says in 1 Corinthian 5 not to even eat with a Christian that is known to be "super bad" that will not repent.  Hmmm... I see that God has given us his Spirit and freedom.  Let's just be legit. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:39, 16 October 2008 (UTC)


I think sparky brings up some good points.  I also think that part of it might have to do with not causing a brother to stumble.  For example, you both know that I enjoy the occasional Newcastle Brown Ale, but at LETU I wouldn't go drinking one or even mentioning it in front of a freshman or even an upperclassman who might struggle with that or struggle with being judgmental (that's a sin too and we shouldn't help cause any sins.) 

On the other hand, I have a friend who cares a *lot* about reputation.  A related example to the last one: this friend thinks that having fun and drinking beer is bad but it's ok if it's wine.  Completely senseless unless you view it through this subset of society where beer is for rednecks and drunks and wine is classy; but we all know that that's totally bs and you can be an alcoholic with both.

And as sparky said we have a lot of freedom in Christ and that's scary for people.  With freedom you have to think.  You can't just follow the rules.  But we know that if we make rules for ourselves all we are doing is crucifying christ again (how terrible!) which is equally bad.

Lately I have been trying to pay attention to our freedom in Christ a lot because at work I was talking to someone about whether or not you can lose salvation and stuff and he (and then my boss) made the good point that it's really hard to believe that you can lose your salvation and then not live by works.

Thoughts?
