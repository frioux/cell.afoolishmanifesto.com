What do you guys think about reputation?

I've been reading this book Radical Reformission by Mark Driscoll (it's the pneuma video guy) and the first chapter and introduction is mostly about the fact that in a lot of ways the church is addicted to morality and not only morality but protecting it's reputation.  For instance (in general not specific (Think LeTourneau culture)) it is kinda awkward for a christian to be in a bar, and you'd kinda think twice about going to a liqour store if your pastor was with you.  Or if you had a gay friend, introducing thme to your christian friends would be awkward.  Or dating a girl who has a kid from a teenage pregnancy.  The list of "sins" we as christians are supposed to avoid is really long.  But we're not only supposed to avoiid them, we're supposed to avoidi the company of people who commit them, and this isn't because we may get "contaminated" (though some churches would say so) but because it might give people a poor representation of christ, i mean ruin the churches reputation by hanging around sinners...

But heres the rub, Jesus had an awful reputation, glutton, drunkard, lover of sinners and in general a disreputable dood.  I realize that there are some practical issues with guys hanging around prostitutes and strippers all the time, or spending tons of your time with drug dealers, or even talking with arabs about middle eastern politics and religion.  And I concede that paul mentions deacons have to be above reproach and this sort of thing... but whats the deal!  I understand the concept that the more your focused on Jesus the less you need to focus on sin because you're following the truth vs avoiding following lies, but why the heck do we (generally here guys not personally) care what people think about us hanging out with sinners, or drinking alchohol, or going to raves, or whatever.. And how do we correlate this with "not ruining our witness."  

If it's not obvious, I'm pretty frustrated here, from stuff unrelated to reputation, but currently I'm kinda funneling my frustration and anger into the issue.  What do you guys think...--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:38, 16 October 2008 (UTC)


Good calls (I'm still at LU, and still around some of that stuff).  A few verses came to mind immediately.  First, Jesus did hang out with the sinners and was a doctor to the sick (mt 9:12-13).  Also (I'm fascinated with descriptions of the early church; I'm writing an exegesis on it), If you look at Acts 2:42-47 you see that the first believers were together, and "had favor with all people."  Tensions rose though.  Look at the dudes like Peter, John, and Paul  They were carrying the gospel to the ends of the world (Acts 1:8, Matt 28:19-20).  THis pissed people off, and they kept being jailed, whipped, etc.  They did end up recieving a bad reputation, especially with the religious authorities.  This is gnarls, "We ought to obey God rather than man" (Acts 5:29b) was their response.  

I believe that, obviously, our reputations are important, but I believe a good reputation is a byproduct, not a focus.  You cited Timothy for being of good character.  The purpose of Paul's instruction there is for Timothy to be able to have somewhat of a standard for picking church leaders.  I think a good way to tell a good person is there reputation (tree/fruit) among believers AND secular society.  Also, you can usually tell when someone is focussed on their reputation, not God.  I think that we need to follow the spirit, wherever he leads, and not worry about our reputation.  Again in Acts, you see Phillip approach a Eunich (an unwhole man), Paul bring uncorcuimszed men into the temple, and Peter piss of James and the Jerusalm church (still strict in a Jewish legalistic sense) for going to Antioch an chillin' with unkosher Christians.  But on the other hand, Paul says in 1 Corinthian 5 not to even eat with a Christian that is known to be "super bad" that will not repent.  Hmmm... I see that God has given us his Spirit and freedom.  Let's just be legit. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:39, 16 October 2008 (UTC)


I think sparky brings up some good points.  I also think that part of it might have to do with not causing a brother to stumble.  For example, you both know that I enjoy the occasional Newcastle Brown Ale, but at LETU I wouldn't go drinking one or even mentioning it in front of a freshman or even an upperclassman who might struggle with that or struggle with being judgmental (that's a sin too and we shouldn't help cause any sins.) 

On the other hand, I have a friend who cares a *lot* about reputation.  A related example to the last one: this friend thinks that having fun and drinking beer is bad but it's ok if it's wine.  Completely senseless unless you view it through this subset of society where beer is for rednecks and drunks and wine is classy; but we all know that that's totally bs and you can be an alcoholic with both.

And as sparky said we have a lot of freedom in Christ and that's scary for people.  With freedom you have to think.  You can't just follow the rules.  But we know that if we make rules for ourselves all we are doing is crucifying christ again (how terrible!) which is equally bad.

Lately I have been trying to pay attention to our freedom in Christ a lot because at work I was talking to someone about whether or not you can lose salvation and stuff and he (and then my boss) made the good point that it's really hard to believe that you can lose your salvation and then not live by works.

Thoughts?

I really like this fREW, "With freedom you have to think."  I think this goes back to the thought of the narrow path.  God gave us a mind, so we need to not be stupid about how we handle ourselves.  Our minds control so much as to whether something is right or wrong.  Romans 14 deals alot with this.  Interesting stuff, "The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God...for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin." Romans 14:22a & 23b.

Thoughts on losing your salvation.  I've come to the point (from a scriptural point of view and tons of discussions) that we CANNOT lose our salvation on account of anyone else.  Now, the only thing that I see that could possibly happen, I do not currently believe this but I don't have a good backup currently, is that someone could make the conscience effort to remove themself from the kingdom (I personally do not see this as possible).  Maybe we should start a thread on this. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 15:27, 22 October 2008 (UTC)


I believe the "not causing a brother to stumble" scripture has played a huge part in determining Christianity's reputation in society.  Way back when, the teetotalers were convinced that drinking alcohol was evil, leading to the ban on alcohol (which gave us Al Capone).  Of course the ban was lifted later, but the idea that alcohol is evil still persists.  If I were to go out and get a drink today and my non-Christian friends were to hear about it, they would immediately assume that I was distancing myself from Christ, though I have not yet seen biblical evidence of why I should not drink (in moderation).  In essence, my drinking would ruin my witness to these people.  In my opinion, Letu law does not allow for anything that anyone might consider "unchristian" and seems to give credence to the outsider's (as in someone ignorant of the tenets of Christianity) viewpoint that the Christian who enjoys the occasional drink or bet is nothing but a hypocrite.

Manhawk, I hear what you are saying, but I think it's not that scripture that caused that.  A Christian who doesn't want to cause a brother to stumble won't drink around that brother; he won't make it illegal for that brother to drink.  I mean, some Christians may do that but I don't think that's biblical or even reasonable.  I am responsible for my own actions and that is all.  Therefore, I should make sure I don't do something that will cause you to sin.  On the other hand, if you go buy a handle of Svedka and drink it in your room at LETU (or home); that's not my fault.  It's not my fault that I didn't keep you from sinning.  That's my viewpoint anyway.  Make sense?  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 15:00, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

Goat, you made an interesting point. You said that Jesus had a reputation as a drunkard, glutton, etc... with the religious authorities. I think his reputation with the sinners he hung out with was completely different, though. He didn't participate in the sins that they committed, and he certainly didn't condone their actions. Jesus was constantly telling parables and preaching the truth to the people. Nonetheless, I think he had a good reputation among them. They realized that he accepted them for who they were, and he cared for them. Maybe that is how we are called to be.

This summer, for those of you who don't know, I worked as a whitewater rafting guide in southeast Tennessee. Pretty much all of my coworkers were uncouth and foul. I came in to work, and I was different. The typical guide sees rafting as the day job and drinking/partying as the night job. Some guys start drinking when they get off the river at 4 or 5 in the afternoon, and they don't stop until they go to bed. I hung out with some of these characters throughout the summer. They realized that I didn't agree with what they were doing. I didn't drink, smoke, curse, or engage in any of the immoral stuff that they did, but I had a good reputation around them. I built friendships with some of the guys. I even had one guy tell me he was impressed that I didn't change around them. I stayed the same. This reputation is what I think Christians should be going for. They knew I was not like them, but I was still around them.

As a side note, I would appreciate your prayers because I want to go back this next summer. I want to be more outspoken about my faith, especially now that I have earned respect for being different.[[User:Dochovan|Doc]] 20:58, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

I know I didn't exactly say this, but I meant that that verse is the reason why the Student Handbook outlaws gambling, drinking, etc.  I personally don't see how there's anything wrong with imbibing a little something-something every now and then solely from the merits of drinking, but I am convinced that my drinking would mess up any inroads I have managed to make with certain people.
