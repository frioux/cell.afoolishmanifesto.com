What do you guys think about reputation?

I've been reading this book Radical Reformission by Mark Driscoll (it's the pneuma video guy) and the first chapter and introduction is mostly about the fact that in a lot of ways the church is addicted to morality and not only morality but protecting it's reputation.  For instance (in general not specific (Think LeTourneau culture)) it is kinda awkward for a christian to be in a bar, and you'd kinda think twice about going to a liqour store if your pastor was with you.  Or if you had a gay friend, introducing thme to your christian friends would be awkward.  Or dating a girl who has a kid from a teenage pregnancy.  The list of "sins" we as christians are supposed to avoid is really long.  But we're not only supposed to avoiid them, we're supposed to avoidi the company of people who commit them, and this isn't because we may get "contaminated" (though some churches would say so) but because it might give people a poor representation of christ, i mean ruin the churches reputation by hanging around sinners...

But heres the rub, Jesus had an awful reputation, glutton, drunkard, lover of sinners and in general a disreputable dood.  I realize that there are some practical issues with guys hanging around prostitutes and strippers all the time, or spending tons of your time with drug dealers, or even talking with arabs about middle eastern politics and religion.  And I concede that paul mentions deacons have to be above reproach and this sort of thing... but whats the deal!  I understand the concept that the more your focused on Jesus the less you need to focus on sin because you're following the truth vs avoiding following lies, but why the heck do we (generally here guys not personally) care what people think about us hanging out with sinners, or drinking alchohol, or going to raves, or whatever.. And how do we correlate this with "not ruining our witness."  

If it's not obvious, I'm pretty frustrated here, from stuff unrelated to reputation, but currently I'm kinda funneling my frustration and anger into the issue.  What do you guys think...--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:38, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
