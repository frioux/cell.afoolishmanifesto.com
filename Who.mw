== Who are you? ==

I thought it would be convenient to start a page where everyone could post a quick bio. I don't know some of you, and I don't recognize some of your handles. Here's my info:

Lee Shaver. I graduated from LeTourneau with a degree in engineering (electrical concentration) in May of 2007. Well, actually, I didn't graduate until December of 2007, because I had to finish Western Civ and Brit Lit. At LU, I lived on Flooders all four years, and served as floor chaplain for the last three. I also served as Wolverine for a short stint in the fall of 2006. I am currently a Peace Corps volunteer in El Salvador, where I spend time teaching English, learning guitar, falling in love with fellow volunteers, and helping community organizations with projects including: buying computers, installing lights in stadiums, creating webpages, and getting clean drinking water. Please read my [http://lamentations324.blogspot.com blog] and look at my [http://www.flickr.com/photos/lshave pictures]. Thanks. [[User:Lshave|Lshave]] 17:05, 30 October 2008 (UTC)


Pford, I think this may work better to stick this info in our user pages, I mean they already exist for that... Unless you have an objection, We'll get this moved soon. --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 22:59, 30 October 2008 (UTC)
