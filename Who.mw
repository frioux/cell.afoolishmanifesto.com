== Who are you? ==

I thought it would be convenient to start a page where everyone could post a quick bio. I don't know some of you, and I don't recognize some of your handles. Here's my info:

Pford, I think this may work better to stick this info in our user pages, I mean they already exist for that... Unless you have an objection, We'll get this moved soon. --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 22:59, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

Neato... what a novel idea. IÂ´ll go move this info to that page. And this page will hopefully serve as a reminder for everybody to put something on their user page, so I know who they are.
