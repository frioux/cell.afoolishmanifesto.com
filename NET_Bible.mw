Today in Sunday school we were going through a passage (1 John 1:1-4) and the Sunday school teacher made it really clear that even in word for word translations like the NASB decisions are made about the meaning of a passage.  (Note the capitalization issues in various translations of the previous passage.)  Anyway, my church does all of its teaching with the NET Bible, which I never really understood.  Today I asked Bill why we use it and I think the reasons are important.

Let me back up and talk about translations for a second.  We all know that there are varying degrees of accuracy and rigidity in a translation.  Rigidity being how "word-for-word" the translation is and accuracy being the amount of good/oldest sources to use.  Of course there is a lot more that goes into it than that, and I am no scholar.  GOAT could probably give us some great comments here.  But the point is really that some translations are better, some are worse, and some are just different but of the same value.  I honestly would be willing to give a kid NLT or NIV.

But in the long term those choices are really not that important.  I say that because in 100-150 years hopefully there will be new translations that will eclipse '''all''' of our current translations.  English changes.  Translations have to keep up.  And this is where the NET Bible is different from all of the rest.

The NET Bible is freely available online.  Yes, I can read the entire Bible in other translations online, but the NET Bible allows me to print it out and distribute it to all of my friends.  NIV?  ESV?  NASB?  As my room mate would say, "Unlegal!"  I think that is an important step to make in Bible translations.  I personally think that a freedom like this is the only reason to keep the KJV around at all, but that's probably just me.

There is another distinction that I think the NET Bible has that others do not: transparency.  You may say, but Frew, if I get the deluxe extended version of the NASB I can read all the translation notes!  That's great if you're rich.  And we are.  But we shouldn't assume that all Christians are.  Check [http://net.bible.org/passage.php?search=1%20John%201:1-4&passage=1%20john%201:1-4#n11 this] out.  How many freely available Bibles give all that information?

So the point is this: yes, there may be better translations, but the NET Bible gives to the future in that all of their translation notes are right there, and they give to the current time by giving away their translation for free.

Now I am going to print out the pages so that I can read the bible while I work out :-)
