Today in Sunday school we were going through a passage (1 John 1:1-4) and the Sunday school teacher made it really clear that even in word for word translations like the NASB decisions are made about the meaning of a passage.  (Note the capitalization issues in various translations of the previous passage.)  Anyway, my church does all of its teaching with the NET Bible, which I never really understood.  Today I asked Bill why we use it and I think the reasons are important.

Let me back up and talk about translations for a second.  We all know that there are varying degrees of accuracy and rigidity in a translation.  Rigidity being how "word-for-word" the translation is and accuracy being the amount of good/oldest sources to use.  Of course there is a lot more that goes into it than that, and I am no scholar.  GOAT could probably give us some great comments here.  But the point is really that some translations are better, some are worse, and some are just different but of the same value.  I honestly would be willing to give a kid NLT or NIV.

But in the long term those choices are really not that important.  I say that because in 100-150 years hopefully there will be new translations that will eclipse '''all''' of our current translations.  English changes.  Translations have to keep up.  And this is where the NET Bible is different from all of the rest.

The NET Bible is freely available online.  Yes, I can read the entire Bible in other translations online, but the NET Bible allows me to print it out and distribute it to all of my friends.  NIV?  ESV?  NASB?  As my room mate would say, "Unlegal!"  I think that is an important step to make in Bible translations.  I personally think that a freedom like this is the only reason to keep the KJV around at all, but that's probably just me.

There is another distinction that I think the NET Bible has that others do not: transparency.  You may say, but Frew, if I get the deluxe extended version of the NASB I can read all the translation notes!  That's great if you're rich.  And we are.  But we shouldn't assume that all Christians are.  Check [http://net.bible.org/passage.php?search=1%20John%201:1-4&passage=1%20john%201:1-4#n11 this] out.  How many freely available Bibles give all that information?

So the point is this: yes, there may be better translations, but the NET Bible gives to the future in that all of their translation notes are right there, and they give to the current time by giving away their translation for free.

Now I am going to print out the pages so that I can read the bible while I work out :-)

Hey fREW, just a note that ESV is freely downloadable for (at least some) Bible Study software... [[User:Benjie|Benjie]] 00:13, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I know, but you can't print it out and distribute it.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 03:56, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I just wanted to put up a post saying that I'm looking into this, sounds promising from a philisophical point of view, i'm not sure yet on a practical level.  pax. --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 13:39, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

Just FYI Goat: you '''can''' buy a copy if you think printing it out is impractical, which it is for the whole Bible.  The nice thing though is that our church doesn't have to pay any royalties to display it in church or print stuff out.  Like 1 John can be printed out in it's entirety, where often printing out more than half a book is breaking the copyright.  Anyway, I just think it's important.  I do still prefer ESV, but I can get behind these details of the NET.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 18:54, 9 March 2009 (UTC)



So, I spent some serious time thinking about this, talking with becci and my small group and came to a few conclusions, as well as a few just points of interest. So first off there is a couple of different talking points, one is the ideal behind the method in which the NET bible was translated and the other is the actual translation itself.  We'll tackle the first question first....

First off I entirely agree with the idea that a bible translation should be free as in freedom.  This is in my opinion our duty as christians to make the bible free and available to anyone for no cost.  But this is a complex idea, up until the first english translation christians depended on their bishops/priests to both read and interpert the scripture.  Now this is extremely limited freedom as well as extremely little responsisbility.  For instance, when we talk about people with limited brain power (children, metally handicapped, animals (double note: this is not deroggatory)) we don't expect them to make complicated abstract decisions, they haven't had the complex input, nor do they have the ability to reason well enoguh to understand the consequences of actions.  Thus with limited abilities/knowledge, responsibility is limited.  This is not an excuse for ignorance, but if you are a farmer in the twelfth century, I'm pretty sure God would not expect you to spend your precious time learning latin/greek to translate His word for yourself.  This idea is presented in the parable of the talents (denarii) you make the best with what you are given, and you have a responsibilty to do your best.

Flash forward to 50 years ago, we've only had the KJV for a very long time but we've discovered lots more greek/hebrew manuscripts (dead sea scrolls) and the archaic english is getting pretty nasty to talk about (I heard a pastor tell the congregation they needed an old Oxford dictionary, like hundred plus years old, to accurate learn the scripture) so some people decide to make a new translation or two with these new manuscripts and newer english.  This results in a myriad of different translations with different philisophies of translation.  So some of them are good for reading bedtime stories (Living translation) some of them are meant to be work for word (NAS/ESV others) some are meant to be more paraphrasical (NIV) and some are meant to fill a specific need (Da Jesus Book (a pidgeon translation), the message etc.)  This is the equivilent of getting another chunk of money to be responsible with.  We have more freedom, and more knowledge, more gifts meaning more responsibility.  Now because we have an idea (limited) of how bibles were translated and we have options we have to make sure that we are using these tools correctly.  It makes it that much more easy to get more out of the text, but also that much more easy to take it and make it something it isn't.  Another caveat is that these people doing the translation are spending a ton of time on this and they are extraordianrily qualified, so they want some sort of compensation, otherwise they can't pay rent.  So big christian book publishers foot the bill and make money selling this translation.

Flash forward to now, with the information revolution and internet and personal computers and stuff.  Before, (as frew mentioned) you could probably get the translation notes with a gargantuous book that came with your bible, but the demand for these are low and so for publishers to want to make this, they're going to want to get a bunch of money for it. But now, they could just publish it on the internet for really cheap, which is great.  But publishers, are used to getting money for content.  This is huge paradigm switch to just give stuff away, you are supposed to buy a bunch of paper with text on it, not just look on your computer.  So we have now hit the crux of the issue, publishers want money for their investment, we want the freedom and info.

So lets make some quick comparisons between a free translation and FOSS (free open source software).  

To write open source software all you need is to know how to code, you could even do it in highschool with a computer science class. If you have bugs in your code, other people may find them and correct them, and most likely the use of your code isn't horribly important.  If the program crashes then you can just restart it, or if the code isn't elegant, the computer will still work.

Contrast this with bible translation which to perform correctly needs very very qualified people, people who have spent their whole lives working with and studying it.  They are often high level professors, language experts and the like.  These people are scarce, these people are expensive, even if they belive in the project, it is hard to spend a lot of free time working on it (remember how busy our profs were?).  And the importance of this application is paramount, this isn't just a program to paint in 3d, this is the basis of peoples beliefs, this is the very Word of God, this is holy.  It takes a significantly different mindset as compared with FOSS.

Now what is the end of this.  I think it's a hard problem, we need the very best people on this, not me and you and this guy down the street, this is not wikipedia, this is not even a text book, it 'has' to be correct.  But these people are not cheap.  We need to compensate them.  That being said I think if you read about the NET bible they are doing a tremendous job of balancing these concerns, and feedback from people outside the commitee of translators is a valuable thing, especially the stylistic points.  However there is a but.

After reading a little bit (not much I agree) I didn't prefer the style.  The second inital question was about the actual translation.  When we translate we must make decisions about interpertation and style.  I wasn't a huge fan of the style, but this is purely preference and I also worry about giving the translation notes out to the public.  

There is a tension in my mind about the fact that this information should be available so people can see it but it's also a responsiblility that's far beyond having multiple translations.  For instance, when you give a bible study and make a controversal statement, or any statement, you try to be very careful that you don't lead people into falsehood.  And when we teach baby christians we often teach them slowly because if you try to jump right into deep theology you'll cause problems.   You must drink milk before you eat meat.  And these translation notes are very very thick meat.  They give a tremendous insight into the original text, but they also give the ability to go so far off the deep end it blows my mind.  

When we look back at the reformation, we look at it as a victory for freedom and we think we are better for it.  And while I agree, there is a reason there was only two denominations before then (orthadox and catholic).  Heresy and false beleif was stomped out by people who knew better.  As soon as people had the ability to look at the bible for themselves, they could draw their own conclusions and if they didn't study very hard they could end up far away from the truth.  Because we have freedom, we have the ability to both disagree and bring others to our side of the argument.  This is usually how cults start.  Now unfortunatly the power of the Catholic church was abused (and probably will be again by others).  

Now if you thought that denominations and quesitons about the validity of belifs were challenged by differing manuscripts and translations wait until people can easily see how translators made decisions.  I worry about people who don't know any better and are led astray..  But then again, that is the price we pay for freedom.

Anywyas, I realize this is a very long post, but I thought a bunch about it...  I guess the end is I want freedom, but I know it will bring problems.  And Personally I want all translations to become free, and their notes to be free as well.  But I find that to be pretty unlikely...--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 15:58, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

I'd like to add two quick points:

1. Nearly all of the translation information one could desire is freely available in the library. Only, you'll have to turn off your computer and go there.

2. As a user of Firefox, gmail, and openoffice user, I am certainly in favor of the open source concept. But in these cases, we're looking at a community of coders fighting against giant corporate powers. But when it comes to Bible translations... most publishers allow you to print significant portions of the Bible. Zondervan, Thompson, etc are not huge mega-corporations trying to lock up the secrets of the Bible. And the NET bible people are not Martin Luther and John Wesley.
