So in the year 2006 I was a sophomore and I wanted an internship.  I had a teacher who indirectly knew someone at a company in Dallas and he got me an interview and gave me some specific pointers for the interview.  I went to the interview and felt pretty good about it.  And then life went back to normal at school.

A few months later it was Easter time (I think) and Lee and I were invited to C-4's for a little Easter shindig.  Now, I don't know about you guys, but every now and then I am overcome with a very serious yearning.  Not like, "I really want this computer," but something more true and real.  Anyway, I had this yearning to be with my good friends in Dallas.  It also may have had something to do with my new girlfriend at the time; who knows ;-)

So anyway, that was a Sunday.  At the time my small group (which interestingly, at the time did not include Lee) met on Mondays, so the next day I went to Cell and I mentioned that I really wanted that job in Dallas so I could be with my friends and stuff.  We prayed about it and the '''next day''' I got an email from the HR rep asking me to fill out forms and stuff so that we could go along with the process.  I hadn't even heard back after the interview and it had been something like two and a half months.

As if that weren't enough, the next week we were meeting as usual and I mentioned that I needed a place to stay for the summer since an apartment was out of the question due to my lackluster internship salary.  Again, the next day I got a phone call from some of my extended (great uncle) family who live in Denton and told me I could stay with them.

Finally, I needed a car to drive to and from work in, and I was telling my small group this (the third week after the Easter trip) and before I finished telling them I needed a car my great uncle called me and let me know that they had a car that I could use for the summer and that the only issue was that it didn't have AC.  So that went from prayer to praise without any action at all on my part.




You may think that this is all coincidence, and it may be; but I am thoroughly convinced that God's hand was in the whole situation.  Why was I in Dallas then?  Why am I here now?  Was it because my spirit longed to be with my friends?  Is there some higher purpose to that summer in my life?  I probably won't know till I die; but one way or another God blessed me that summer and continues to every day.

Now I am gonna go get some free coffee!  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 15:31, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

I don't think that this was some coincidence.  I think that everyone in the Cell Group at that time can stand witness to what happened.  I think that reading about a miracle, vs. experienceing it is totally different too.  For example, I tend to not think to much about reading about other peoples' "miracles."  But, there have also been several in my life that I can not deny.  I don't know.  I think this skepticism I have is possibly a result of my upbringing.  I have no problem seeing God's work in my life, but I have a porblem accepting it in people that I'm not sure about, or wasn't involved in the miracle.
