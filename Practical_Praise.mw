So, I was inviting someone to church the other day and they asked what you do at church.  And I told them about what we normally do and then it struck me, that I feel just fine telling someone about the fact we study the bible and think about what Jesus said and try to implement the truth we read into our lives.  But, I could not for the life of me explain praise in a way that didn't make me sound like a crazy.  I have a couple ideas, but I was curious on your guys' thoughts.    --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:26, 27 May 2009 (UTC)
