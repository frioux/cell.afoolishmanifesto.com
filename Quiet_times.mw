So, I thought it would be appropriate to bring up the issue of quiet times.  From my understanding, it was a term that was coined not too long ago.  It is something that seems to be talked about in every evangelical youth group.  What is a quiet time?  Dr. Hood brought up an interesting point in class today.  She said that quiet times are never mentioned in the Bible; however, Joshua 1:8 says "This book of the law (the Pentateuch) shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success."  So, it seems to me that this whole concept of a "quiet time" is a creation of the church, as well as devotionals.  I guess that also brings up the question, "what is a devotional?"  

I guess the reason that I bring this up is because I see a lack of definition of it from external sources as well as in my own life.  I have done all sorts of routines of devotionals, prayer, singing, journaling, etc.  I've done it in the morning, in the evening, whenever, once a day, twice a day, alone, with others, you get the point.  I think that this confusion/lack of concrete definition is a good thing though.  My "quiet times" have morphed significantly over time, but I see the correlation between quiet time activity and my maturity and what God is teaching me.  I see the God/man thing in the context of a personal relationship, so I also see it grow/change like a relationship.

I have defined "Quiet Time" in my life as the time that I have set aside to specifically spend with God and nothing else, but this has many facets. Currently, I spend time in the afternoons (usually with tea or coffee) in Bible study.  I spend a minute in prayer, a couple of minutes in journaling, and then somewhere between 30-60 minutes studying Luke with an academic commentary.  I also kinda count my wiki activity in this group since it is similar to my Bible study time with Goat and Frew.  So that is quiet time part 1, while quiet time part 2 consists of going to Speer to spend time seeking God in prayer and journalling.  This time usually lasts 30-60 minutes.  God also breaks though in some crazy ways occasionally.  For example, I was pretty happy the other day that I have my whole "routine" established.  I was spending my minute or two in prayer when the Spirit convicted me putting my quit time in a box.  I was able to spend the next 5-10 minutes enjoying his presence in a pretty rare way (shouldn't be rare).  Last night in prayer, I didn't really say anything.  

So, here's some stuff on quiet times.  COmments?

So, first off, i think I would disagree with Dr. Hood on this one, there is a number of times where Jesus would withdraw early in the morning to seek time alone with his Father (to pray usually) and I think that's probably where the modern equivilent of "quiet time" came from.  I would also put forth the idea that the reason we have the term "quiet time" and it is so prevelent is a function of both our culture and our society.  In america at least, marketing can take any handy phrase and make it ubiquitous, for instance, take WWJD, what does that mean, define that, it's a question, not a statement, designed to provoke thought about actions in the context of how christ would respond.  But we have books and magazines and bracelets and tattoos and all sorts of ridiculous marketing to push this simple idea: try to think like jesus.  So "quiet time" met up with somebody who knew how to market and boom, it's all over america.  However, it's tied to culture, because, for example, in australia "Devo" means deviant, pervert and the like, so using it to talk about devotions never really caught on...

Anyways enough disecting of american slang terms for making time for Jesus... I think the main ideas of devotions come from a combination of the Jewish temple worship, prayer, study of the scripture and fellowship.  In christianity we tend to separate these things, church, quiet time (prayer), sunday school and potlucks respectively.  But in my estimation this is really just beacuse we suck at following the directions Christ gives us about devotions.  The best "devotions" i have ever experienced was up on the floor where we had daily study of the word ( in community), daily pray (both community and personal) and weekly communal worship, along with fellowship constantly with other believers.  That was some serious devotions, a potent cocktail of seeking God alone and in groups.  

However, when I moved up here to NY the church becci and I started to attend does this thing called "monastic and missional" where we work monastically (within the church) to do all of those things we did at school, but also missionally where we go out into the world to work and minister to the world.  I think it's pretty awesome, because looking back at my career at LU, it was really really good for sharpening people and building up people, and building the body of christ, but in general, we really sucked at reaching the world.  Maybe that's not the point but I don't know.. thoughts?
