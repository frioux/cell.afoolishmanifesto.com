So, I thought it would be appropriate to bring up the issue of quiet times.  From my understanding, it was a term that was coined not too long ago.  It is something that seems to be talked about in every evangelical youth group.  What is a quiet time?  Dr. Hood brought up an interesting point in class today.  She said that quiet times are never mentioned in the Bible; however, Joshua 1:8 says "This book of the law (the Pentateuch) shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success."  So, it seems to me that this whole concept of a "quiet time" is a creation of the church, as well as devotionals.  I guess that also brings up the question, "what is a devotional?"  

I guess the reason that I bring this up is because I see a lack of definition of it from external sources as well as in my own life.  I have done all sorts of routines of devotionals, prayer, singing, journaling, etc.  I've done it in the morning, in the evening, whenever, once a day, twice a day, alone, with others, you get the point.  I think that this confusion/lack of concrete definition is a good thing though.  My "quiet times" have morphed significantly over time, but I see the correlation between quiet time activity and my maturity and what God is teaching me.  I see the God/man thing in the context of a personal relationship, so I also see it grow/change like a relationship.

I have defined "Quiet Time" in my life as the time that I have set aside to specifically spend with God and nothing else, but this has many facets. Currently, I spend time in the afternoons (usually with tea or coffee) in Bible study.  I spend a minute in prayer, a couple of minutes in journaling, and then somewhere between 30-60 minutes studying Luke with an academic commentary.  I also kinda count my wiki activity in this group since it is similar to my Bible study time with Goat and Frew.  So that is quiet time part 1, while quiet time part 2 consists of going to Speer to spend time seeking God in prayer and journalling.  This time usually lasts 30-60 minutes.  God also breaks though in some crazy ways occasionally.  For example, I was pretty happy the other day that I have my whole "routine" established.  I was spending my minute or two in prayer when the Spirit convicted me putting my quit time in a box.  I was able to spend the next 5-10 minutes enjoying his presence in a pretty rare way (shouldn't be rare).  Last night in prayer, I didn't really say anything.  

So, here's some stuff on quiet times.  COmments?
