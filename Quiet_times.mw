So, I thought it would be appropriate to bring up the issue of quiet times.  From my understanding, it was a term that was coined not too long ago.  It is something that seems to be talked about in every evangelical youth group.  What is a quiet time?  Dr. Hood brought up an interesting point in class today.  She said that quiet times are never mentioned in the Bible; however, Joshua 1:8 says "This book of the law (the Pentateuch) shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success."  So, it seems to me that this whole concept of a "quiet time" is a creation of the church, as well as devotionals.  I guess that also brings up the question, "what is a devotional?"  

I guess the reason that I bring this up is because I see a lack of definition of it from external sources as well as in my own life.  I have done all sorts of routines of devotionals, prayer, singing, journaling, etc.  I've done it in the morning, in the evening, whenever, once a day, twice a day, alone, with others, you get the point.  I think that this confusion/lack of concrete definition is a good thing though.  My "quiet times" have morphed significantly over time, but I see the correlation between quiet time activity and my maturity and what God is teaching me.  I see the God/man thing in the context of a personal relationship, so I also see it grow/change like a relationship.

I have defined "Quiet Time" in my life as the time that I have set aside to specifically spend with God and nothing else, but this has many facets. Currently, I spend time in the afternoons (usually with tea or coffee) in Bible study.  I spend a minute in prayer, a couple of minutes in journaling, and then somewhere between 30-60 minutes studying Luke with an academic commentary.  I also kinda count my wiki activity in this group since it is similar to my Bible study time with Goat and Frew.  So that is quiet time part 1, while quiet time part 2 consists of going to Speer to spend time seeking God in prayer and journalling.  This time usually lasts 30-60 minutes.  God also breaks though in some crazy ways occasionally.  For example, I was pretty happy the other day that I have my whole "routine" established.  I was spending my minute or two in prayer when the Spirit convicted me putting my quit time in a box.  I was able to spend the next 5-10 minutes enjoying his presence in a pretty rare way (shouldn't be rare).  Last night in prayer, I didn't really say anything.  

So, here's some stuff on quiet times.  COmments?

So, first off, i think I would disagree with Dr. Hood on this one, there is a number of times where Jesus would withdraw early in the morning to seek time alone with his Father (to pray usually) and I think that's probably where the modern equivilent of "quiet time" came from.  I would also put forth the idea that the reason we have the term "quiet time" and it is so prevelent is a function of both our culture and our society.  In america at least, marketing can take any handy phrase and make it ubiquitous, for instance, take WWJD, what does that mean, define that, it's a question, not a statement, designed to provoke thought about actions in the context of how christ would respond.  But we have books and magazines and bracelets and tattoos and all sorts of ridiculous marketing to push this simple idea: try to think like jesus.  So "quiet time" met up with somebody who knew how to market and boom, it's all over america.  However, it's tied to culture, because, for example, in australia "Devo" means deviant, pervert and the like, so using it to talk about devotions never really caught on...

Anyways enough disecting of american slang terms for making time for Jesus... I think the main ideas of devotions come from a combination of the Jewish temple worship, prayer, study of the scripture and fellowship.  In christianity we tend to separate these things, church, quiet time (prayer), sunday school and potlucks respectively.  But in my estimation this is really just beacuse we suck at following the directions Christ gives us about devotions.  The best "devotions" i have ever experienced was up on the floor where we had daily study of the word ( in community), daily pray (both community and personal) and weekly communal worship, along with fellowship constantly with other believers.  That was some serious devotions, a potent cocktail of seeking God alone and in groups.  

However, when I moved up here to NY the church becci and I started to attend does this thing called "monastic and missional" where we work monastically (within the church) to do all of those things we did at school, but also missionally where we go out into the world to work and minister to the world.  I think it's pretty awesome, because looking back at my career at LU, it was really really good for sharpening people and building up people, and building the body of christ, but in general, we really sucked at reaching the world.  Maybe that's not the point but I don't know.. thoughts?

I like your points Goat.  Your church sounds awesome to.  I think we do get alot of the "monastic" side on Flooders, but not the mission stuff.  I also agree with your views of the totality of quiet times.  This also reminds me of some interesting verses in Lamentations (reading the context is necessary, but I have not included it here due to brevity)

25The LORD is good to those who wait for him,
   to the soul who seeks him.
26 It is good that one should wait quietly
   for the salvation of the LORD.
27 It is good for a man that he bear
   the yoke in his youth.

28Let him sit alone in silence
   when it is laid on him;
29 let him put his mouth in the dustâ€”
   there may yet be hope;
30 let him give his cheek to the one who strikes,
   and let him be filled with insults. (ESV)

What do you guys think about these[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:49, 1 November 2008 (UTC)


So I had an interesting talk with an old friend about daily Bible reading.  What is more important, daily Bible reading, or application of the Bible?  There are obviously people who read the Bible, but don't do it.  Also, the purpose of a pupil (disciple) is to become like the teacher, not know all of the rules.  The early church didn't have scripture to read each day, especially not the NT.  The only verse that I can think about that deals with this is Joshua 1:8.  I guess I have kinda changed my stance a slight bit in that I don't automatically cringe when I hear that someone doesn't read their Bible every day.  I also don't think that it is an excuse to not read the Bible, and I still think that everyone should suck it up and read it daily.  What do you guys think? [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 20:57, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

Hmm... so I agree with the theory that application is the bible is more important than the reading, this is fairly apparent with how Jesus treats pharisees and scribes.  But it's also apparent that He really knew the bible (the law at that point).  And personally, I know that it is dang near impossible for me to really be applying the bible without reading it daily or near daily.  I think that's probably something build in to humans, or maybe lacking.  The idea being that naturally we're sinners and so we sin, but the more we read the bible and pray the more it corrects us and gets us going in the right direction kind like how if you have a car with bad alignment you have to keep adjusting the steering wheel to make it drive straight.  The less often that the adjustment happens the farther off course you get.  I know this is true in my life.  I think you hit on something else too when you mentioned "suck it up" and read daily, because I've been thinking lately about discipline and how it is something thats important, but protestant christians often confuse discipline with tradition and habit and look down on it.  However, it's highly praised in proverbs and ecclesiastes.  Something to chew on...--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 00:17, 8 January 2009 (UTC)


Some other verses have been going in my head.  John 8:31-32 says "... If you continue in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine; and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free." John 15:7 "If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."  Luke 9:23 "And he was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.""  Sure, it's more important to apply God's word, but God even uses the times (and stuff that I've read) that I don't want to read, or when I'm not really focusing well, etc. to change me, and the Holy Spirit can still bring that stuff to remembrance (John 14:26).  God's word will not return void (Isa 55:10-11), is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path (Psalm 119:105) and is also a double-edged sword (Hebrews 4:12).  The pastor of the church that I have been visiting said this (about the pastors/leadership), "If you aren't reading the Bible on your own, won't be able to help you." [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 02:24, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

I think something that has stuck with me is the idea that God's word does not return void. IE, if you put it in you it's going to be good, whether it is at the time or not.  When I stay in the word it stays in me and while I don't "need" to read every day, I have deffinetly noticed a correlation in spiritual life vs reading.  Plus, i find that the more I read (being into it or not) the more i find I remember it, just stanard repitition. Neat huh... --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 19:59, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

That's kinda like the reason that the orthodox cross has a diagonal line across the bottom.  Because our relationship with God is always either growing or shrinking, but never just static.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 16:24, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
