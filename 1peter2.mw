Verse 16, what does freedom mean to you?

Read this song snippet (Five Iron Frenzy, Anthem)
"
Freedom isn't free

So let me say what freedom means to

It cannot mean to serve ourselves

That doesn't mean a thing

It doesn't mean to give the license

To seek ourselves in anything

That would be slavery to ourselves it isn't free

Jesus Christ, the only thing that freedom means to me.
