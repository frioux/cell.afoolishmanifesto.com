=Predestination=
I used to question Calvinism in a way that Steven Paulson, writing on Martin Luther, so clearly puts “What if the Holy Spirit starts selecting some and not others? What then of your God? God doesn’t play dice, right? What about free will?  If you take justification by faith alone that distinguishes law and gospel as your center point, then isn’t everything in the world turned upside down?” (Paulson, 2004, p. 29).

I have been studying reformed theology for the past several months, and as a result some of my theological views have changed.  I once held to a semi-Arminian view of salvation, but after much studying of scripture and other resources, I have changed to a Calvinistic view of salvation.  Although many of the concepts tied to predestination are tightly linked to other theological concepts, I have tried to just share some of the things directly linked to predestination.  I have tried to keep this short, but at the same time show some of the reasons why I have come to the convictions that I now hold.  I have tried to split this up into coherent sections so that if you do not want to read all of this, then you can pick and choose as you wish.

==Overview of Predestination==
I once had a Bible Professor with a PhD in Divinity teach my [http://www.term-paper.biz/custom-term-paper.html term paper] class that predestination was simply that God had, before the creation of the world,  prepared a plan of salvation in Jesus, and that it was up to man to decide whether he was going to accept or deny that plan.  That is basically what I used to believe.  Although predestination is quite a hot topic, the fact that the Bible mentions predestination means that it is important and that every believer should study it (Erickson, 1992, p. 287).  
 
Figure 1 The Terminology of Predestination, Adapted from Introducing Christian Doctrine
For the sake of clarity, I will define predestination as “God’s choice of individuals for eternal life or eternal death.”  The choice of life being election and the choice of death being reprobation (Erickson, 1992, p. 288). Two of the biggest views on this subject are Calvinism and Arminianism .

==Calvinism==
One of the common ways to explain Calvinism is the acronym TULIP

Total depravity (no one is capable of saving oneself)

Unconditional election (God’s choosing of the saved isn’t conditioned by anything in them)

Limited atonement (Christ’s atonement is adequate to save all people but it is efficient for God’s elect only)

Irresistible grace (the sovereignly given gift of faith cannot be rejected by the elect)

Perseverance of the saints (those who are regenerated and justified will persevere in the faith)  

The basis of this view is that all of mankind is sinful, and is so sinful that the offer of grace cannot be accepted through free will.  The state is so bad “that sinners have lost the ability to do good and are unable to convert themselves” (Erickson, 1992, p. 288).  According to Martin Luther, typical theology starts by looking into oneself to find something not affected by sin to build off of which theologians call “free will”, but this free will is “the source of every single sin” (Paulson, 2004, p. 14).  For Calvin, Election is the decision of God either to select the congregation of Israel for his own or a person for a certain job.  This is especially true of salvation (Eph 1:4-5).

God’s election is absolute and unconditional.  It might, or might not, follow as we think it should (see the example of Jacob and Esau).  These choices that he makes are dependent on him and have nothing to do with the people involved (Rom 9:15-16).  Erickson breaks down the basic Calvinistic beliefs into 5 categories:

# The election of God is not based “upon foreseeing that the individual will believe.  It is the cause, not the result, of faith” (Erickson, 1992, p. 289).  
# God’s call/election is effectual in that it cannot be resisted.  The one destined to salvation will be saved, and the one destined for destruction cannot escape it.
# Election is an eternal decision.  God always does what he has always planned on doing.
# Election is unconditional and has nothing to do with meeting certain conditions before God.
# Election is immutable.  God will never change his mind.
Another concept that I find important is that most Calvinists do not see that election contradicts free will .  Also, the concept of double predestination is important.  Reality is that some go to Heaven and others go to Hell.  One view is that God chooses some to be saved, while leaving others in their sin.  The view of double predestination means that God chooses some to be saved and some to be condemned (Romans 9:21-23 for example). 
==Arminianism
The first concept that is important to this view is the idea that God wants everyone to come to salvation.  If God desires all to come to salvation, and we know that not all do, there must be something that keeps them from God.  This “thing” is freewill, a person’s choice to choose or reject God’s salvation on their own accord.  The second important concept is that all people are able to come to or qualify for salvation.  So, this means that God’s grace is essentially the same on all, and that God does not need to give more grace for one to be saved.  The third important concept is the role of foreknowledge in God’s “election .”  This is different from Calvinism, because it says that “those who are predestined by God are those who in his infinite knowledge he is able to foresee who will accept the offer of salvation,” (Erickson, 1992, p. 291) which is based on the person’s decision.  The primary passages used in defense of this position are Romans 8:29 and 1 Peter 1:1-2.  
==Against Calvinism==
Arminianism opposes the Calvinistic view of predestination as the unavoidable choice of God.  Many people within this view think that Calvinism is fatalistic, saying, “what’s the point if God has already predetermined everything?”  If this is true, then “ethical behavior becomes irrelevant,” and salvation is not determined on how one lives (Erickson, 1992, p. 291) .  Another reason it is opposed is that missions are thought to be seen as unnecessary . 
==Against Arminianism/Free will in Salvation==
I believe the foundation of any theological view must be found in scripture. With this being stated, I think that an accurate view of Calvinism needs to be reconsidered .    
The human condition is quite sinful and wretched and will not change by itself (Rom 3 etc).  The condition is so bad that “they are unable to do anything to extricate themselves from this condition, and in fact, being quite blind to their situation, have no desire to do so” (Erickson, 1992, p. 292).  Also, sinners are blinded to what God is doing (Rom 1:18-23, 1 Cor 2:14, 2 Cor 4:3-4).  What sinner would actually choose God?  The Arminians believe that there is a “universal enablement” for salvation, but where is this in scripture?  They only use a few verses, and I question the way that they use them .  Also, there are numerous portions of scripture that show that God chooses some to be saved apart from anything that those people had done, and the decision was made prior to the existence of the universe (see Error! Reference source not found.).  

The Arminian view that predestination is determined from God’s foreknowledge is weak.  The verbiage used to speak of God’s foreknowledge in Romans 8:29 and 1 Peter 1:1-2 implies that this foreknowledge is more than a “foreknowledge in advance,” but it “carries the connotation of a very positive and intimate relationship” suggesting “looking upon with favor or loving someone” (Erickson, 1992, p. 293) . God’s “foreknowledge” in these verses seems to be more of an active knowledge of his predestination than a passive knowledge of an event that he has no say in.  Waldron points out from Bauer’s Standard Greek Lexicon that foreknowledge here “asserts that the meaning of this word in Romans 8:29 and Romans 9-11 is ‘choose beforehand’ and in 1 Peter 1:2 ‘predestination’.  It is crucial to notice that in these passages it is not something about the elect which is foreknown, but they themselves who are foreknown” (Waldron, A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, 1989, pp. 69-70).  “Only that which is certain to happen may be foreseen or foreknown.  To foresee something is to be certain that it will happen.  Since, however, it is God’s decree that makes certain all that shall occur, nothing can be foreseen as certain to happen until God decrees that it shall” (Waldron, A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, 1989, p. 68).  

Another argument against Calvinism is that some people might want to be saved, but since God has only selected a few people, that he rejects them from salvation.  Can this actually take place?  No. The only reason that someone would want to be saved is if that Father is drawing that person (John 6:44).  The fact is that God does offer the free gift of salvation to all, but because of sin no one will accept it without a special work of God.

What about free will in salvation ?  Luther calls it “precious myths of free will and partial grace” (Paulson, 2004, p. 64).  This goes back to the fact of the depravity of man.  As Erickson so clearly puts it, “humans in the unregenerate state are totally depraved and unable to respond to God’s grace, there is no question as to whether they are free to accept the offer of salvation—no one is!” (1992, p. 293).  On the other hand, is anyone able to reject the call of God? The answer is also no.  What about faith?  According to Luther, faith is not “”Accepting,” or “deciding for,” or “committing oneself to Christ” or any of the misuses this word has received.  Faith is perfect passivity… or simply suffering God” (Paulson, 2004, p. 51).  Luther also saw the church “weaving its own story around Scripture in order to make law, free will, and God’s grace fit together” (2004, p. 59).  “If Christ were everything then free will would be nothing” (Paulson, 2004, p. 65).
==Implications of Predestination==
Erickson has put forth four implications of predestination 
# We should not worry about God’s plan.  What he has decided before the foundation of the world will be accomplished, and his elect will come to salvation
# When rejected while sharing the gospel we can rest knowing that Jesus himself was often rejected
# “Predestination does not nullify incentive for evangelism and missions” (1992, p. 293), considering know one knows who the elect are.  God has explicitly stated that we are to carry the gospel to the ends of the world (Matt. 28:18-20, Acts 1:8, Romans 10:14-15), and uses our proclamation of the gospel to save his elect.
# Necessity of grace.  “There is nothing in the individual that persuades God to grant salvation” (1992, p. 293).
# This mystery must be held with special care, so that it may be a “matter of praise, reverence and admiration of God, and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation to all who sincerely obey the gospel” (Waldron, A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, 1989, p. 61). 
==Various Verses and Quotations==
===Various Verses===
I have used the English Standard Version available from e-sword for all scripture quotations below.
Psa 115:3  Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases. 

Psa 135:6  Whatever the LORD pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps. 

Jer 15:2  And when they ask you, 'Where shall we go?' you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: "'Those who are for pestilence, to pestilence, and those who are for the sword, to the sword; those who are for famine, to famine, and those who are for captivity, to captivity.' 

Mat 22:1  And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, 

Mat 22:2  "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, 

Mat 22:3  and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. 

Mat 22:4  Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat 
calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.' 

Mat 22:5  But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, 

Mat 22:6  while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. 

Mat 22:7  The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 

Mat 22:8  Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. 

Mat 22:9  Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.' 

Mat 22:10  And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. 

Mat 22:11  "But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. 

Mat 22:12  And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. 

Mat 22:13  Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 

Mat 22:14  For many are called, but few are chosen." 


Mat 25:34  Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 

Joh 6:44  No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. 

Joh 6:64  But there are some of you who do not believe." (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 

Joh 6:65  And he said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father." 

Joh 10:26  but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock. 

Joh 10:27  My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 

Joh 12:37  Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, 

Joh 12:38  so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: "Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" 

Joh 12:39  Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said, 

Joh 12:40  "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them." 

Joh 13:18  I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, 'He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.' 

Joh 17:9  I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. 

Rom 1:18  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. 

Rom 1:19  For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 

Rom 1:20  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. 

Rom 1:21  For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 

Rom 1:22  Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 

Rom 1:23  and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. 

Rom 8:28  And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. 

Rom 8:29  For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. 

Rom 8:30  And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. 

Rom 9:6  But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, 

Rom 9:7  and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named." 

Rom 9:8  This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring. 

Rom 9:9  For this is what the promise said: "About this time next year I will return and Sarah shall have a son." 

Rom 9:10  And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, 

Rom 9:11  though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad--in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call-- 

Rom 9:12  she was told, "The older will serve the younger." 

Rom 9:13  As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." 

Rom 9:14  What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! 

Rom 9:15  For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." 

Rom 9:16  So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. 

Rom 9:17  For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." 

Rom 9:18  So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills. 

Rom 9:19  You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?" 

Rom 9:20  But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?" 

Rom 9:21  Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for dishonorable use? 

Rom 9:22  What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, 

Rom 9:23  in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory-- 

Rom 9:24  even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? 

Rom 11:5  So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. 

Rom 11:6  But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. 

Rom 11:7  What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, 

Rom 11:8  as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day." 

Rom 11:9  And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; 

Rom 11:10  let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever."

Eph 1:4  even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love 

Eph 1:5  he predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, 

Eph 1:6  to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. 

1Th 1:4  For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, 

1Th 1:5  because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. 

1Th 5:9  For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

1Th 5:10  who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. 

1Ti 5:21  In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality. 

2Ti 1:9  who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, 

2Ti 2:19  But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity." 

1Pe 1:1  Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 

1Pe 1:2  according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you. 

1Pe 1:5  who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 

1Jn 2:19  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. 

1Pe 2:8  and "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. 

1Pe 2:9  But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 

1Pe 2:10  Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. 

Jud 1:4  For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. 


===Various Quotes===
“The [London Baptist] Confession affirms both the absolute sovereignty of God and the reality of human freedom.  Deny or mitigate either truth and Calvinistic Christianity will wither and die.  Thus there are two rationalistic extremes which will kill biblical Calvinism wherever they arise.
# There is the minimizing or denial of the reality of human freedom.  Deny or mitigate the reality of human freedom in the interest of preserving the sovereignty of God.  This will lead to a rigid hyper-Calvinism and, so to speak, freeze the water of life.
# There is the minimizing of God’s sovereignty to preserve human freedom.  This will lead to Arminianism and to the ‘evaporation’ of the water of life.
The common assumption of both extremes is that somehow divine sovereignty and human freedom are inconsistent and mutually exclusive principles…Van Til, however, with the reformed confessions, teaches that God’s freedom and man’s freedom do not conflict.  Neither has to be limited in order to preserve room for the other.  Man’s freedom is not God’s freedom.  Human freedom does not challenge divine freedom, but coexists with it” (Waldron, A modern exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, 1989, pp. 65-66).
“Salvation is not the progress of a spiritual athlete for whom practice in the law makes perfect.  It is not even like a sick person getting well on the medicine of grace, for those pictures of Christian life leave Christ on the sidelines while human free will takes center stage.  Such notions leave Christ idle, displacing him by the star of that drama, the free will that dreams of becoming ever more holy under the law.  Why then the cross?  Did Christ come simply to remind people of the law that Moses already gave, or even to give an improved version of the tablets of stone?  Is Christ to be patient while you try to solve the puzzle of God’s law?  The story of Scripture, Luther began to understand, is not how we make our way up the mountain by getting grace and then topping it off with love and works.  Scripture is the story of how God came down to meet us—while we were yet sinners” (Paulson, 2004, pp. 62-63).
“Lazarus did not come out of the grave because he got his free will in motion to choose resurrection; it was because he received an external command from God’s word, which does what it says” (Paulson, 2004, p. 79).
“Original sin is the very sin that entered the world, as Paul puts it, “through one man” (Rom 5:12), but is repeated in endless variation: Jesus cannot really mean “Take and eat, for this is my body,” or “You have not chosen me, I have chosen you,” or “Your sins are forvgiven,” can he?  That would seem to make him the only salvation and take away my part to play—and I refuse to be ignored!” (Paulson, 2004, p. 111).
“People do not want their righteousness to be in Christ alone; they want to be molded into the right image n themselves so that justification starts with faith but ends with a life full of acts of love that imitates Christ’s perfect life” (Paulson, 2004, p. 154).
==Luther and Erasmus==
In 1524 Desiderius Erasmus and Luther debated on the subject of the role of free will in salvation.  One of the main topics discussed was whether or not Pharaoh’s heart was hardened by God.  While Luther’s stance was that the human will was bound in regards to salvation, Erasmus proclaimed that it was a trope, “a turn of phrase that doesn’t mean what it straightforwardly says” (Paulson, 2004, pp. 112-113).  Erasmus had to make an explanation, other than the obvious, or God would be “responsible for evil,” and it would “take away Pharaoh’s free will.”  This conclusion that God hardening Pharaoh’s heart must be a trope, Erasmus was manipulating the words to fit his “assumptions about free will and its secret for of atheism” (Paulson, 2004, p. 114).
“Erasmus preserved something for the free will; otherwise, humans would be mere puppets in the hands of God and God would then be an evil puppeteer who plays with us for mere entertainment and laughs at our troubles.  That conclusion, however, required that Erasmus reverse mercy and wrath and so lose any sense for either of them…God’s mercy became delayed judgment pending on the actions of one’s free will; God’s wrath became any unilateral and unconditional divine act (including God’s forgiveness of sinners).  What would happen if God just up and forgave one day?  For Erasmus that would rob humans of free will, and they would need to deny it.  What happens if a preacher comes announcing the forgiveness of sins on the account of something Christ did long ago in history?  Run for your life, lest such a preacher take your precious free will.  Better to preserve faith in your own faith than to be forced against your own will to receive a unilateral word from God that you cannot resist—like the terrible word, “I forgive you”!  Better to live with reason’s own self-made theory than to have a God who decides, foreknows, destines, and forgives unconditionally in his son Jesus Christ…Erasmus achieved the great feat of defending himself against God’s unconditional forgiveness n a gargantuan pyrrhic victory for free will.” (Paulson, 2004, pp. 114-115).

So Sparky, I have a question for you: What made you decide to start looking into reformed theology?  Most of the people I know believe they have already sufficiently looked into it and come to some conclusion.  While I was in LH 130A once, I overheard some guy telling someone else that he was printing off a paper for one of his Bible classes over the cult of predestination.  It almost made me laugh at loud (especially since I know some of the professors are Reformed).  That, however, is the view that most people I've talked to seem to have.

Secondly, have you heard of people who start as Calvinists, read up on Arminianism, and then change their views?  I haven't (although I'm sure it's happened somewhere, creating a nice little Markov chain problem for someone to work out).  The reason my views lean more to the reformed side is because the flow of logic in the reasoning appears to be much smoother.

And third, in most of the discussions I've had about this topic, the opponent seemed to think that Calvinists and hyper-Calvinists are one and the same.  I think the misunderstanding that Calvinists think humans are robots has led to close-mindedness on the issue (if only everyone followed the Socratic method (is it possible to say someone is close-minded without appearing close-minded?)).

Sparky, I will read this eventually, and then I will respond. But first I would encourage you to consider learning the wiki syntax.  Look, we got a '''real''' table of contents automatically :-) [[User:Frew|Frew]] 23:27, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

Thanks fREW!  I had planned on formatting it all, but didn't have the time when I posted.  

Manhawk, what made me look into reformed theology is the church that I am currently going to.  It is Southern Baptist (part of the SBC), but holds to a reformed theology (not the norm for Southern Baptists).  The first sunday I was there, the sermon was over Gen 19 where Lot was dragged out of Sodom.  The pastor mentioned stuff about predestination, and what he said made more sense out of the scriptures than what I had been taught.  The second (and most important) thing was when I started studying the London Baptist Conffession of 1689 (Baptists were traditionally reformed in theology).  The confession is really backed up by scripture, and I have been reading every single scripture reference that is given.  There has been some things that just hadn't made a whole lot sense to my prior thinking (a good example is Rom 9), that make much more sense.  Another big thing was to check out an overview of Luther's theology (the book I quote above) and Augustine's theology (I'm currently reading Calvin's "Institutes of the Christina Religion").  I have been trying to let scripture say what it says instead of imposing my opinions on it, and this is where I currently am.  I fully aggree with your second point, "The reason my views lean more to the reformed side is because the flow of logic in the reasoning appears to be much smoother"

I haven't heard of people that started reformed and changed.  Just about everyone that I have talked to (which is quite a few people now) has made the same change that I have with a few exceptions of people who started out reformed (I guess I wouldn't find the opposite in a reformed setting though).  

On the third point, that's where I was only a few months ago.  I truelly thought I was not close minded, but I was.  [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 17:11, 8 April 2009 (UTC)


Due to some general life craziness Becci and I discovered a rather interesting quirk of logic/philosophy and it relates to this particular theology.  My personal take on predesntination was that because God was all knowing, he could know many alternative futures and depending on our choices they would snap into place (see Terry Pratchett for more references...)  So you could say that he knew the future, however, which future was unknown.  However, this was pretty much a thought experience until very recently.  Recently (today actually) Becci and I are participating in a dual reality.  We should receieve a phone call or e-mail that will determine which future we get.  Basically I might receive a job offer, and if that's the case I have the next 3 weeks planned out or so, what we're going to do, where we'll be, what will happen (plus a bunch of who knows...) If I don't receive the job offer then I also have the next 3 weeks planned out (different plans obviously).  So we know (as well as a human can know) what is going to happen these next three weeks, because we have our futures planned for both possibilities.  However, we don't know which will happen.  A choice by someone (not us in this case) will determine which "known" future we get.  It's a pretty wierd, yet cool idea.  I realize that to apply this to predestination requires a pretty big scale up of the idea, but irregardless, it is pretty dang cool, mostly because I am currently experiencing a limited version of the thought experiment.  Neat huh?   Charis kai eirene.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:16, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
