== Frew's Heart (Testimony) ==

A lot of people believe in God because it was what they were raised with, logic tells them God is real, they feel something, whatever.  I think that all of these are valid reasons and I am not going to say that everyone needs to come to faith a certain way.  My reason for believing in God is that he saved me.  Not eternally, but physically when I was just a wee lad.

When I was born one of the valves in my heart was too small.  The first doctor that looked at it said that they'd have to do open heart surgery on me when I was old enough (three or four).  My mom is a nurse and this just broke her heart, because she knew that if they did open heart surgery on such a small kid it would have long lasting effects; you know, lack of oxygen to the brain does these things.

My mom contacted all of her brothers and sisters and parents and had them pray about it over the next few years.

So the doctors had their ultrasounds and scheduled us to come back when I was four (I remember this part because it took forever.)  So we went to the hospital (years later of course) and they did the ultrasound and the doctors told my mom that they had never seen a recovery like it.  They said that nothing like this had happened in their careers and that my parents should keep doing whatever they were doing.

To this day I haven't had any issues with it.  Hopefully I will continue to be healthy and strong.  But either way, I can say without a doubt that God is real and (for some reason) cares about me.
