I know that in person we've covered comparing free will vs predesntination, but we haven't touched on it on the forum yet.  My pastor mentioned an interesting point last sunday.  So we often compare and contrast the idea of predestination and free will.  But the problem is that we (collectively) tend to run them to the extremes which results in two things. 
 Either a hyper-calvinistic viewpoint where it isn't worth doing any mission work because either God chose you and you '''will''' be saved or He hasn't and you won't.  This nicely locks up eternal security.
Or the alternating viewpoin (systematic theology) is that we need to construct absolutely iron clad arguments and force people into believing by appealing to their intellect/emotions and do lots alter calls to get them to come forward and say the sinners prayer.  This also implies that you should live a good life and repent of your sins.  Because if you change maybe your salvation changes.
However, his idea was that rather than try to take theology to these extremes (it's like taking an analogy/metaphor too far) we should view it more from a pastoral viewpoint where theology is less ology (science) and more imitating Christ.  This would mean that sometimes we cast down peoples arguments against God and sometimes we just pray for people to hear Gods voice.  
We were talking about the passage in John 6 about eating Christ's flesh and Drinking His blood, and how it made people frustrated and turn away.  And when Becci and I discussed it later we decided that first people had to "really hear" with Gods help to be drawn to Him, but they also had to make a personal choice to follow.  And toss in the "God is not in time" idea to really seal the deal.

Finally here is the example that the pastor gave to explain pastoral theology:  
If a drug dealer/murderer came to a pastor and told him that at one point he has said the sinners prayer and thus is saved forever because God chose him.  At this point the pastor would lean towards free will salavtion and infer that he really needs to clean up his life if he wants to prove out his salvation.
If a christian is having lots of doubts and comes to a pastor and this point the pastor would point to Gods divine choice which would give the christian consolation and peace.  
Basically the idea is to not  minimize either Gods divine choice or our choice to follow Him, but to look at it wisely and reasonably, especially admitting our own ignorance of Gods perfect will and try to follow Him and bring others to him but acknoledgeing that we will never fully understand the mechanics.
