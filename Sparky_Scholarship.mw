Senior year of high school I was looking at going to two different schools: John Brown and LeTourneau.  I had visited both (that's when I decided that LeTourneau was the place for me), had been accepted to both, and saw how much each was going to cost. I couldn't afford either school, but I knew that LeTourneau was where I was supposed to go.  Senior year I had a teacher that taught my physics, calculus, and engineering classes.  We were pretty close (she was a believer), and for several days I felt I needed to talk to her about my financial situation (I had been praying about it).  So, I talked to her one day after class, and told her that I had been accepted to both schools and where the finances stood.  She said that she didn't want finances to be the reason I didn't go, and said "I'll help pay for you to go."  So I have had a significant scholarship for 9 semesters now that has made tuition about the price that going to a state school would have cost! [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 02:42, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
