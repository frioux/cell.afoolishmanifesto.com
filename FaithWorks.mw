I've spent a significant time struggling with what exactly the Bible says about faith and works, especially over the summer and last semester.  I'll try to keep this kinda short.  Some of the passages that I have spent a significant amount of time in are James 2:14-26, Romans 3:21-4:12, 5:1,  10:9-10, Hebrews 11, and Ephesians 2:8-10.  I think that this is possibly one of those topics that we can't fully understand, but I still don't think that that should keep us from studying it.  I think that the most tension is between James' and Paul's writings.  Alot of the arguments and examples use Abraham (and Rahab, but I'm only going to talk about Abraham).  James 2:21,24 uses Abraham as an example (cf v 20) that faith without works is useless: “Was not Abraham our father justified by by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar...you see a person is justified by works and not faith alone.”  Romans 3:28 says “For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.”  Romans 4:1-3 says that Abraham was not justified by, but rather by faith.  Hebrews 11:8-12, 17-19 (using Isaac as James does) also talks about Abraham.  The writer mentions faith, but physical action (i.e. Moving to Canaan) seems somewhat implicit.

I think one of the keys to understanding this stuff is that it is crucial to look at the purposes and audiences the authors addressed.  For instance, Paul addresses people who seem to have been focusing on works as a means of salvation (and hence all of the commentary on the law and circumcision).  Paul is trying to battle people that are teaching a gospel that says that you need to be circumcised and follow the law in order to receive eternal salvation, so he emphasizes the necessity of faith.  In Ephesians 2, Paul states that grace through faith is what saves someone.
 
One of the central verses that I have spent a ton of time with is James 2:19 “You believe that God is one; you do well.  Even the demons believe—and shudder!”  I think this points back to the Shema, which is found in Deuteronomy 6:4 and was fundamental to Jewish beliefs (“Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one”).  This seems to say that proper theology does not “save” someone.

It appears that James says contrary things to what Paul preaches.  James seems to be dealing with a church that has become extremely relaxed as far as actually doing anything, so it is no surprise that most of his book deals with actually doing something.  Over the summer when I taught a Bible study on James, I used a commentary by a guy named Douglas J. Moo.  Moo brought up some interesting things that I had never thought about.  First, he sees a distinction in some of the terminology that Paul and James use.    Moo says that Paul's works are works that “precede conversion” and James' works “follow conversion.”  I also see that some of Paul's “works” deal with the law (although some do deal with love and such).  Also, Paul's use of justification seems to be the initial conversion that results in a right standing with God, while James uses it more in the sense of the final judgment.  So, Moo is saying that works before conversion do nothing, while works after conversion justify you in the final judgment (see also 1 Corinthians 3:10-15).

Here's an interesting quote by Martin Luther “O it is a living, busy active mighty thing, this faith.  It is impossible for it to not to be doing good things incessantly.  It does not ask whether good works are to be done, but before the question is asked, it has already done this, and is constantly doing them.  Whoever does not do such works, however, is an unbeliever.  He gropes and looks around for faith and good works, but knows neither what faith is nor what good works are.  Yet he talks and talks, with many words, about faith and good works.”

I know this is kinda jumbled, but it is a huge topic and also deals with stuff in the Salvation posts.  What do you guys think about Faith and Works? [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 19:53, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
