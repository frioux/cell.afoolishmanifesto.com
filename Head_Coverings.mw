So, I was at dinner the other night and the subject of wearing hats while praying came up.  I've done some previous research on this topic, but it has been a while so I conducted some more.  The verses that mention this are 1 Corinthians 11:2-16.  I think that a lot of interesting things are going on here.  First, Paul makes some interesting comparisons between Christ and man, man and woman, and God and Christ (the first being the head of the second).  He then this as the foundation of his following argument on head coverings.  So, man is the head of his wife (note the word play on figurative and literal meaning of head).  What does this actually mean?  I know that it is obviously not to boss her around, or on the contrary to be run over.  Both men and women were created in the image of God, and woman was created because man needed her.  Also, he says that men are the image and glory of God, and women are the glory of man.  He says that man and woman are not independent of each other, but the man is still the head of the woman.  The longer that Heather and I have dated, the more that I have been able to understand that in a marriage relationship that neither one is better than the other, but the husband is still the "head."  What do you guys/girls think about this whole thing?  I also think that the curse in Genesis 3:16 is interesting.  Below is some information that I pulled from a couple books.

Anyways, supposedly the Greek/Roman and Jewish praying customs for wearing head coverings differed, and Paul needed to settle the issue.  Greek/Roman men prayed with their heads covered, but Jewish men did not.  Also, a woman covering her head was supposed to be a sign of the authority God had given her (I'm not sure where this comes from).  The head was, at the time, a symbol of the source of authority.  In verse 7 it mentions something about cutting off the hair of a woman, which was the punishment for prostitutes back then.  (from Zondervan's Handbook to the Bible).

So, back then a woman's hair was viewed as a lustful thing.  I don't think it is quite that way, but I do agree with Paul that a woman's hair is her glory (I still remember the first time that I saw Heather in the 4th grade, and it was her hair that attracted me).  So, because of this view of hair, women were expected to cover their heads.  A modern-day example of a woman uncovering her head might be a woman wearing a provocative swimsuit.  I guess that this lustful view was more of a lower-class concern, as the upper-class women tended showed off their hair styles.  This caused a tension between the two classes.  Paul uses (this is for fREW) the principle of ''reductio ad absurdum'' by telling them that if they really don't want to cover their heads, why not just chop off there hair (one of the most shameful things that a woman could do)?  A woman's uncovered head would also draw attention away from God and to the woman.  This instruction from Paul is for the women of the time and not current-day women.  (IVP Background Commentary: New Testament).

It seems to me like the point of all of this is that we need to be careful in the way we dress for worship so that we do not draw attention to ourselves or violate someone else's conscience.  I personally feel that I have the freedom in Christ to pray with a hat on if it doesn't bother anyone else.  What do you guys think?[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:21, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

Personally I prefer to pray with a squirrel on my chin.  Interesting research, because I haven't done the same I can't really offer much in the way of "biblical" thoughts, though I will say it smacks to me of culture.  And unfortunatly whenever the topic of culture comes up you have to somehow make the jump from grecco/roman/judeo culture to todays culture.  To complicate matters I would argue that todays culture is even more cosmopolitan thus the variations make it even harder to make a hardine determinination on whether or not the practical action of praying with or without a hat is appropriate...... so on the topic of hats, I personally go for the old fashioned standard of you remove hats to show respect (see military, inside buildings of old people, etc) and thats about as far as I go on that topic.  I also don't think to much about women and hats, let them figure it out...
As far as the women and men head of the house thinger bobber... This is something that Becci and I have thought about and worked on for a while.  I'll have to think about it a bit more before I write down my opinion...--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 11:57, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

I do have something more to add.  Though Sparky and i have discussed the men/women relationship stuff, head coverings got somewhat bypassed.  Because our culture IS more cosmopolitan, few women cover their heads while praying or going to church.  When i wear a hat, it is for one of three reasons:  (1) my hair is extremely dirty and i lacked the will or time to do anything better (i can count these occurrences on one hand), (2) it's cold outside and/or my hair is still wet, or (3) it's cute.  In the first scenario, nothing is getting my baseball cap off my head!  In the others, my reasons for wearing a hat are either superficial to create aesthetics or purely utilitarian.  In the former case, it would be disrespectful and distracting to me and (maybe) everyone else for me to keep a hat on; in the second, the interior of a building removes its usefulness.  For the most part, i adhere to a context of respect when determining what to do.  

Also, is hair really that lustful??  It's just strands of protein...not even alive!  Cutting the hair (mourning and punishment) would remove the aesthetic value associated with a beautiful coif, but perhaps it is more to lessen the pride of the woman in question than to remove lust in others...similar to a man's beard or squirrel being plucked out.    --[[User:Calli|Calli]]  10:39, 28 October 2008 (OUHSC)

Are breasts really lustful, I mean they're just mammary glands whose purpose is to produce milk for infant feed, or butts, they're just a combination of muscles and fat that help us climb stairs and cushion our seats, how about big biceps, they're totally utilitarian, they just help us lift things... Like it or not, Lust can be attributed to just about anything, the whole is more than the sum of the parts.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 15:18, 29 October 2008 (UTC)
