So, one of the things that I've been thinking about for the past couple of months is living righteously among the unrighteous.  It seems to me that it is almost more important to live righteously around unbelievers than belivers (reality is that we should be awesome all the time).  I was eating with some pretty awesome guys at church Sunday, and one of them told me some stuff that really encouraged/convicted me.  So, this guy was really high in a big company.  His coworkers knew he was a Christian, but they thought he was just talk.  So they set up a woman to approach him and waited in the bushes to see his response (he did not know they were watching).  He handled the situation correctly, and they other guys were amazed.  He realized that it probably wasn't going to be good to stay working around those guys, but he ended up leaving because of a couple other things.  He found out that his company had been cheating another company out of a ton of $$$$, so he approached one of the top guys and called him on it.  The guy he talked to was actually a pastor, and didn't even really see it as stealing, and then basically said he was ok with it.  So, my friend called this dude out on his Christianity.  Being a pastor and all, he didn't like it so much.  My friend told the other company what had been going on.  Also, he was unhappy with his job because he was not allowed to proclaim the gospel to all of his customers.  I was kinda taken back over this.  I think I do a pretty good job at work, but there are so many decisions, actions, conversations, etc. that have a ton of opportunities to either live like Christ, or the world.  I don't think that it's hard to live a passive Christian life.  For instance I don't cuss and the guys at work don't hear me talking about how I got totally wasted last weekend.  I think the real difficult part is to really actively be light in the darkness.  For instance, I have alot of theological conversations at work.  Good stuff, right?  but sometimes the other guys bring up some pretty interesting theology that is unbiblical.  I call them on it occasionaly, but should I everytime?

Also, here's another thing that I have thought about over the past several years--music.  So, I used to be against secular music.  After quite a few conversations with Lshave, I got some secular music.  Here's an example: Jambi by Tool.  So like the music is really awesome, and the words of that particular song apper to be pretty sweet.  I remember talking to another Christian and Tool came up.  His response was "Tool hates God."  He wasn't against secular music, but that was his impression of the artist.  So, the wrestle has been the decision to listen to some of the "good" songs (the ones that I deem the lyrics acceptable), or throw out all secular music.  My current stance (this is for me, I'm not saying this in general) is the latter.  One of the reasons is that the associations with the bands that I was listening to their "good" songs were not good.  Secondly, I found it much easier to get sucked into other songs because I like the sound of the band.  I want to be above reproach, so I ditched all of my secular music.

As a side note, I've had quite a few conversations with coworkers about church, finances (from more of a Biblical perspective than worldy), Bible reading, etc. and I have actually seen changes in my coworkers.  I think the further from reproach, and the more I speak up for what is right, the better.  What are your thoughts?  I have a feeling music is going to be a hot topic... [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 17:18, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

Hmm... I suppose you could say I feel partly responsible for this.

Obviously, there are a bunch of different sub-topics here that I could pounce all over, but I won't do that. Instead, I will affirm that what you are talking about is obviously a very important topic.  As a side note, I think it might be a good idea to start a page specifically about music, as I feel it would merit its own conversation.

As a Peace Corps volunteer, I am in a peculiar situation. First of all, I am strictly prohibited from proselytizing to Salvadorans. There is, of course, no restriction on what I say to other volunteers. Secondly, when volunteers get together, it is usually in San Salvador, the capital, a city of some two million people. It is chock full of your usual grocery stores, malls, movie theaters, etc. Volunteers often like to get together at bars and clubs. I often get invited out to different bars and clubs, and I usually go. It is a great place to meet other volunteers. I developed a taste for beer in El Salvador, and when we go out, I usually enjoy a beer or two, but never in excess.

I was raised in a Baptist church, where the feeling was that anyone who knows what alcohol tastes like is automatically less holy than someone who doesn't. This is an interesting position, because that makes lots of people holier than Jesus, who, being Jewish, would have had at least four cups of wine every year at Passover from the age of 13 onward, not to mention all the other Jewish holidays.

I'm not trying to turn this topic from music to alcohol, so let me get to the point. On multiple occasions, sharing a beer with a fellow volunteer has led to the opportunity to talk about my faith. On one particular occasion that I remember, a volunteer who was ending his service invited me to a beer, and we had a long conversation about Christianity. He believed that Christians only cared about whether they were going to Heaven or Hell, and had set an impossible standard for being able to get into Heaven. As a result, he did not believe in Christianity. He said that if Heaven was going to be full of the kind of Christians he knew, then he didn't want to be there anyway, because it would be like Hell for him. I shared with him my own frustration at this heaven/hell focus in Christianity, saying that personally I believe that only God knows who will or won't make it, and we should just leave the whole matter to him while we apply ourselves to serving our fellow-man, which is what Jesus told us would be the standard for getting into Heaven anyway. 

So my point is this: “Whatever is not of faith is sin.” Alcohol, music, theology, money, church, Bible reading; it's all neutral. They can be used for good or evil. Personal conviction is the standard in this arena. Each of us are called to evaluate the situation in which God has placed us to see how we should behave towards and around those whom he has placed in our lives.

Sparky, I don't think we are to call anybody out on anything unless we are somehow responsible for them. However, I feel that God does use us as light to do just that. Our example as followers of God is the light into the darkness. Consider this—what speaks louder to my fellow volunteers: That I shun alcohol and never go to bars with them, or that I go to the bars with them, without getting drunk, and have heart-felt conversations with them about the deeper meaning of life? In this way, the “neutral” alcohol has been transformed into a vehicle by which God's light is shined into someone's life.

There's more I would say, but I think it's best to pause here and see what other discussion results.

Thanks Bro.  I wasn't really trying to focus on music, I just thought it would draw some interesting discussions (I also agree that it would be worthy of starting a page when someone has the time).  I guess I'm not really thinking along the lines of "calling someone out."  Here's an actual scenario--I was talking with a couple of coworkers and the topic of forgiveness came up.  One of the guys said that God was a really forgiving God and was going to pretty much forgive everyone.  I saw this a a pretty major contradiction of God's actual character, and described a more Biblical view of forgiveness.  Anyways, I think there are alot of times that I can interject Biblical perspectives (I shared the Biblical view of marraige earlier today) in nonconfrontational ways.  I think I should do it more.  I also think that there are times to confront people, like if they are doing something illegal or whatever.

I agree with you on the bar stuff.  It's another thing that I have been thinking about.  I've been to a few bars recently.  I have no problem with people drinking here and there, but I don't agree with getting drunk (eph 5:18 & Hos 4:11 & it just makes you look stupid).  I do not drink alcohol myself, but that is because I get a bit into my drinks, and before long I'd be brewing and distilling my own and spending $$$$ on the best stuff etc.  I know how the typical Southern Baptist (that's what I grew up with) view of drinking, but I wonder what the view of the world is of Christians drinking?  I hang out in the reformed circles now, and it seems like they don't mind at all.

I'll be bassically living in another city for work for at least several weeks.  I'm sure this'll produce all sorts of other thoughts/questions/opportunities/etc. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 17:21, 19 June 2009 (UTC)


Sparky, I think I understand you a bit more now... perhaps I got a little carried away. I agree with you that there are certainly times to confront people, and also that it is important to give witness to to Biblical viewpoints, but the manner in which you do this should depend on the audience. I think there are times to simply speak of your perspective and your reasons for believing that way, without mentioning the Bible, and there are other times to reference specific scriptures. However, I suppose what i was getting at earlier is that regardless of the situation, audience, or topic, our principal efforts should be to _live_ as light, and not just talk about it. In this way, our lives will lead to important conversations, and we will be able to back up what we say with evidence from what those we interact with have seen as true in how we act.

I can't write too much as I'm at work, and I think both of you have brought up some very interesting stuff.  Lee, it seems to me like you have changed significantly in El Salvador (of course.)  Anyway, I just kinda wanted to +1 this.  Recently in Sunday School our leader mentioned being Light among Darkness and asked what that looked like.  Someone there said that it meant praying at the table in public.  Now, I don't know about you guys, but if I were a non-Christian I'm not gonna go look over at these praying Christians and be all "Wow...  WOW!!!  They are praying!  Let's be like them!"  That's just ridiculous!  I think as Christians we need to care for people.  Their minds (emotional stability, education,) bodies, and souls.  I think that first one gets left out a lot as people think that once you are a Christian any emotional issues will just fall away.  I know someone who has been a Christian for probably 30 years but she is still probably bipolar.  And one last thing: often people say that love is a choice, and not a feeling.  I agree with that.  But I also think that people aren't idiots, and that you shouldn't lie.  That means that if you are "loving" someone, but you don't actually care about them, it's more offensive than if you hadn't done anything at all.  This doesn't get you off the hook for service; I think it means that you need to work hard to see people from Jesus' position: love.  Otherwise all those little annoying tendencies that everyone has will make it impossible for you to witness to people because you care (why Jesus did) instead of witnessing because That's How To Get Into Heaven.

I may have rambled some there, but my main two points come from personal experience.  Think back to a time when someone was trying to do the right thing for you, but it was clear that they were just doing that, without actually caring.  I certainly didn't like it when it happened to me (this was while I was in Honduras btw.)  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 21:26, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

I would like to repeat frew, you have changed a lot Lee, and awesome, I'm glad you like beer now, we can go grab a pint when you roll through Troy.  In general, I think all of the salient things have been mentioned already, however, I'd like to recommend a book.  It's called "Radical Reformission" by Mark Drischoll, and the majority of it talks about this idea of being a light in the darkness.  I think the major points that it brought to my attention were non-christians were in lots of ways very much like me, except they didn't have Jesus.  And the biggest thing I can do to be a light is to love them.  That means becoming their friend, hanging out with them, talking with them, about big things, little things, sharing a pint, sharing sorrows, hopes and dreams and life.  And over time they will realize that something is very different.  Because like it or not, our viewpoint on the world is different.  I had a good friend, this last year and over the course of the year, I realized that I had soemthing very different then him.  And through the course of various philisophical dicussions on quantum mechanics, happy hours (beer and cheap food), and homework I was able to talk to him about Jesus.  But it wasn't anything in particular that was smart or well thought out on my end.  Just being friends and him seeing me day in and day out and that my life was consistent.  It was an extremely different expereince then any other "light in the darkness" / evangelical expereince.  Because it wasn't like selling a product, apparently, that whole "they will know them by their love for one another" chunk of scripture is accurate.. go figure.  Anyways, the idea of correcting people is kinda different dynamic, because calling people out in my opinion should be reserved for other christians.. and we shouldn't really neeed to be alight in the darkness for them.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 18:15, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

I totally agree that we need to love others, and our "good works" attitudes or whatever will stem from our love for them, and not the other way around.  I think Goat got the point that I've been thinking about--correcting other people.  Let's say you have a "professing" Christian, and this person comes in your office/pub/shower and shares something either boarderline blasphemous or pretty outrageous.  I guess it doesn't really matter what the person professes, as long as he/she is talking about Christ/YHWH.  Anyways, I think that we should be correcting that person (not necessarily in a disciplinary form, but more like "the Bible actualy says xyz about ...").  It seems to me that we would be doing more harm by allowing blasphemousish stuff to be uttered without a response from us without at least bringing up the Biblical perspective.  The contrast would be to say someone was wrong by taking communion once a quarter vs. once a week or something else a little less weighty.  Is this clear? [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 16:59, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

I don't think you can make rules like that Sparky.  First off I don't think God needs us to stop people from making fun of him or whatever.  He will deal with them when that needs to happen.  Now if I hear a person that I am close enough to and who trusts me then yeah, sure.  But like, I don't even think it would be right to correct certain guys on the floor about something like that because without a mutual respect what you say is not gonna come off as wise or true, but as Holier-than-Thou.  So I'd say people you consider to be close, sure correct them.  But if you are thinking to yourself whether they are saved or profess to be saved then you probably aren't in the position to say anything as you probably aren't in that close of a relationship with them.  We've discussed it before but it doesn't hurt to repeat, Christianity is about a relationship with God and a relationship with people.  Doing right should come from that, but doing right is <strong>not the goal</strong>.   [[User:Frew|Frew]] 20:20, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

What about Jesus?  What about the apostles?  What about the prophets?  Did they not correct people?  Now, I think we need to not throw pearls before swine, but I think it can be a great opportunity to share the gospel. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 16:46, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

I think you misunderstood me.  I am <strong>not</strong> talking about the gospel.  I'm talking about morality.  Go ahead and share the gospel.  I'm all for that.  What I am saying is in relation to when you said, "I guess it doesn't really matter what the person professes, as long as he/she is talking about Christ/YHWH....It seems to me that we would be doing more harm by allowing blasphemousish stuff to be uttered without a response from us without at least bringing up the Biblical perspective."  Why do we need to counter that stuff if the people aren't going to listen?  Or more importantly, unless we are specifically coming at it from the angle of love (not correction!) I'd say that correcting them on this front is useless. (Christians should be corrected, I'm talking about the unsaved case) [[User:Frew|Frew]] 18:45, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

I think most of the intellectual stuff thats on here is pretty much ok by me, it comes down to a question that istn't easy, and it comes down to a bunch of deffinitions of "correcting,"  "Response" so on and so forth.  Personally, this is what I've observed, if we are in a conversation talking about this stuff directly (not "dood I'm moving in with my girlfriend this week"), actually discussing the morality, philosophy, whatever.  Then it is entirely appropriate, in context to ask people to back up their views.  If someone says it's ok to be a christian and live with their girlfriend, ask why this is ok.  If it comes down to thats what they think, then fine.  You can reply that this is what I think, and this is why.  But like it or not, people don't believe the same things about the bible, how the bible should be applied, exception clauses, liberty in christ, and so on and so forth.  We, as conservative, scientisty types usually have well thought out opinions about lots of things, this isn't the case for everyone.  It's not our job to force our logically surmised opinions down their throats, but it is ok to question them and suggest perhaps they are full of crap.  Hopefully they will think about things, and pursue Christ and his word, but I don't think we need to be the Gospel/morallity police. [[User:Goat|Goat]]
