So, one of the things that I've been thinking about for the past couple of months is living righteously among the unrighteous.  It seems to me that it is almost more important to live righteously around unbelievers than belivers (reality is that we should be awesome all the time).  I was eating with some pretty awesome guys at church Sunday, and one of them told me some stuff that really encouraged/convicted me.  So, this guy was really high in a big company.  His coworkers knew he was a Christian, but they thought he was just talk.  So they set up a woman to approach him and waited in the bushes to see his response (he did not know they were watching).  He handled the situation correctly, and they other guys were amazed.  He realized that it probably wasn't going to be good to stay working around those guys, but he ended up leaving because of a couple other things.  He found out that his company had been cheating another company out of a ton of $$$$, so he approached one of the top guys and called him on it.  The guy he talked to was actually a pastor, and didn't even really see it as stealing, and then basically said he was ok with it.  So, my friend called this dude out on his Christianity.  Being a pastor and all, he didn't like it so much.  My friend told the other company what had been going on.  Also, he was unhappy with his job because he was not allowed to proclaim the gospel to all of his customers.  I was kinda taken back over this.  I think I do a pretty good job at work, but there are so many decisions, actions, conversations, etc. that have a ton of opportunities to either live like Christ, or the world.  I don't think that it's hard to live a passive Christian life.  For instance I don't cuss and the guys at work don't hear me talking about how I got totally wasted last weekend.  I think the real difficult part is to really actively be light in the darkness.  For instance, I have alot of theological conversations at work.  Good stuff, right?  but sometimes the other guys bring up some pretty interesting theology that is unbiblical.  I call them on it occasionaly, but should I everytime?

Also, here's another thing that I have thought about over the past several years--music.  So, I used to be against secular music.  After quite a few conversations with Lshave, I got some secular music.  Here's an example: Jambi by Tool.  So like the music is really awesome, and the words of that particular song apper to be pretty sweet.  I remember talking to another Christian and Tool came up.  His response was "Tool hates God."  He wasn't against secular music, but that was his impression of the artist.  So, the wrestle has been the decision to listen to some of the "good" songs (the ones that I deem the lyrics acceptable), or throw out all secular music.  My current stance (this is for me, I'm not saying this in general) is the latter.  One of the reasons is that the associations with the bands that I was listening to their "good" songs were not good.  Secondly, I found it much easier to get sucked into other songs because I like the sound of the band.  I want to be above reproach, so I ditched all of my secular music.

As a side note, I've had quite a few conversations with coworkers about church, finances (from more of a Biblical perspective than worldy), Bible reading, etc. and I have actually seen changes in my coworkers.  I think the further from reproach, and the more I speak up for what is right, the better.  What are your thoughts?  I have a feeling music is going to be a hot topic...

Hmm... I suppose you could say I feel partly responsible for this.

Obviously, there are a bunch of different sub-topics here that I could pounce all over, but I won't do that. Instead, I will affirm that what you are talking about is obviously a very important topic.  As a side note, I think it might be a good idea to start a page specifically about music, as I feel it would merit its own conversation.

As a Peace Corps volunteer, I am in a peculiar situation. First of all, I am strictly prohibited from proselytizing to Salvadorans. There is, of course, no restriction on what I say to other volunteers. Secondly, when volunteers get together, it is usually in San Salvador, the capital, a city of some two million people. It is chock full of your usual grocery stores, malls, movie theaters, etc. Volunteers often like to get together at bars and clubs. I often get invited out to different bars and clubs, and I usually go. It is a great place to meet other volunteers. I developed a taste for beer in El Salvador, and when we go out, I usually enjoy a beer or two, but never in excess.

I was raised in a Baptist church, where the feeling was that anyone who knows what alcohol tastes like is automatically less holy than someone who doesn't. This is an interesting position, because that makes lots of people holier than Jesus, who, being Jewish, would have had at least four cups of wine every year at Passover from the age of 13 onward, not to mention all the other Jewish holidays.

I'm not trying to turn this topic from music to alcohol, so let me get to the point. On multiple occasions, sharing a beer with a fellow volunteer has led to the opportunity to talk about my faith. On one particular occasion that I remember, a volunteer who was ending his service invited me to a beer, and we had a long conversation about Christianity. He believed that Christians only cared about whether they were going to Heaven or Hell, and had set an impossible standard for being able to get into Heaven. As a result, he did not believe in Christianity. He said that if Heaven was going to be full of the kind of Christians he knew, then he didn't want to be there anyway, because it would be like Hell for him. I shared with him my own frustration at this heaven/hell focus in Christianity, saying that personally I believe that only God knows who will or won't make it, and we should just leave the whole matter to him while we apply ourselves to serving our fellow-man, which is what Jesus told us would be the standard for getting into Heaven anyway. 

So my point is this: “Whatever is not of faith is sin.” Alcohol, music, theology, money, church, Bible reading; it's all neutral. They can be used for good or evil. Personal conviction is the standard in this arena. Each of us are called to evaluate the situation in which God has placed us to see how we should behave towards and around those whom he has placed in our lives.

Sparky, I don't think we are to call anybody out on anything unless we are somehow responsible for them. However, I feel that God does use us as light to do just that. Our example as followers of God is the light into the darkness. Consider this—what speaks louder to my fellow volunteers: That I shun alcohol and never go to bars with them, or that I go to the bars with them, without getting drunk, and have heart-felt conversations with them about the deeper meaning of life? In this way, the “neutral” alcohol has been transformed into a vehicle by which God's light is shined into someone's life.

There's more I would say, but I think it's best to pause here and see what other discussion results.
