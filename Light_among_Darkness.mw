So, one of the things that I've been thinking about for the past couple of months is living righteously among the unrighteous.  It seems to me that it is almost more important to live righteously around unbelievers than belivers (reality is that we should be awesome all the time).  I was eating with some pretty awesome guys at church Sunday, and one of them told me some stuff that really encouraged/convicted me.  So, this guy was really high in a big company.  His coworkers knew he was a Christian, but they thought he was just talk.  So they set up a woman to approach him and waited in the bushes to see his response (he did not know they were watching).  He handled the situation correctly, and they other guys were amazed.  He realized that it probably wasn't going to be good to stay working around those guys, but he ended up leaving because of a couple other things.  He found out that his company had been cheating another company out of a ton of $$$$, so he approached one of the top guys and called him on it.  The guy he talked to was actually a pastor, and didn't even really see it as stealing, and then basically said he was ok with it.  So, my friend called this dude out on his Christianity.  Being a pastor and all, he didn't like it so much.  My friend told the other company what had been going on.  Also, he was unhappy with his job because he was not allowed to proclaim the gospel to all of his customers.  I was kinda taken back over this.  I think I do a pretty good job at work, but there are so many decisions, actions, conversations, etc. that have a ton of opportunities to either live like Christ, or the world.  I don't think that it's hard to live a passive Christian life.  For instance I don't cuss and the guys at work don't hear me talking about how I got totally wasted last weekend.  I think the real difficult part is to really actively be light in the darkness.  For instance, I have alot of theological conversations at work.  Good stuff, right?  but sometimes the other guys bring up some pretty interesting theology that is unbiblical.  I call them on it occasionaly, but should I everytime?

Also, here's another thing that I have thought about over the past several years--music.  So, I used to be against secular music.  After quite a few conversations with Lshave, I got some secular music.  Here's an example: Jambi by Tool.  So like the music is really awesome, and the words of that particular song apper to be pretty sweet.  I remember talking to another Christian and Tool came up.  His response was "Tool hates God."  He wasn't against secular music, but that was his impression of the artist.  So, the wrestle has been the decision to listen to some of the "good" songs (the ones that I deem the lyrics acceptable), or throw out all secular music.  My current stance (this is for me, I'm not saying this in general) is the latter.  One of the reasons is that the associations with the bands that I was listening to their "good" songs were not good.  Secondly, I found it much easier to get sucked into other songs because I like the sound of the band.  I want to be above reproach, so I ditched all of my secular music.

As a side note, I've had quite a few conversations with coworkers about church, finances (from more of a Biblical perspective than worldy), Bible reading, etc. and I have actually seen changes in my coworkers.  I think the further from reproach, and the more I speak up for what is right, the better.  What are your thoughts?  I have a feeling music is going to be a hot topic...
