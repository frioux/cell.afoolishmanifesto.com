You have all noticed how odd it is to hear "religious" people pray vs people who really know God.  So I thought I would note a couple of things God has been showing me about prayer.  Mostly it's just been because I've been comparing how we talk to people vs how we talk to God.

Inccessent use of "God, Lord, Jesus:"   So you've all heard people, "Lord, we praise you, Lord we love you, Lord we want to see you" The prayee who uses a name of God about once every sentence.  So where do we see this in normal life?  I think it's most common when you think the other person really isn't listening.  Think of a little kid, "Daddy can you help me, daddy can we watch tv, daddy please."  It's as though the other side of the conversation is busy and not really paying attention.  However, when you talk to someone face to face and they are obviously paying attention you never need to reference them in coversation because it's obvious by eye and face contact that they're paying attention.  In my  opinion this illustrates practical "lack of faith"  where we "believe" that God cares about our prayers, but really deep down, we think He's deffinetly up there, He just doesn't give a rip.  More or less the superflurous use of His name demonstrates we dont' believe He's listening.

Christianese:  I've also been thinking about the semantics of how we pray, it's like a different language that no one else uses.  And really one we don't understand all that well.  I guess you could compare it to when you don't actually know a coding language, but you have a couple of examples so you just string together bits and pieces you've heard in a way to kinda say what you want.  But because you don't really get it it's basically junk.  And after a while you should learn to replace those prepackaged pieces of code wiht stuff you acutally understand and wrote.  Specifically I was thinking of how we use praise as a verb.   I never use praise as a verb, I use adjectives I understand to exalt someone and by doing so give them praise.  Ex:  I praise you frew for your tea selection vs  Frew that tea you picked is freaking awesome, you da man.  The first uses the word praise, the second actually results in someone being praised.  The same could be said about blessing, and lots of other christian words that I don't actually understand or use....

Waiting to listen:  This is the one i've been struggling with the most, and it makes sense I suppose.  So if you pray through the "Lord's Prayer"  after a while it feels like a laundry list, this in my opinion is because if you talk to a person for 20 minutes without allowing them to say anything in response, you might as well be giving a presentation.  It just makes me wonder about it, I mean "coming before the Lord" could mean a prewritten speech of requests, but it should also mean just talking, which is two way... hmm.. no conclusions yet..

What do you guys think?

I completely agree with this stuff, but I can relate to the last part the most.  The Lord's Prayer formula that Dr. Graff explained is really solid, but I have always wondered where the part was where we actually listen to God.  See, my problem is that I tend to do the prayer and I am worn out by the time I get to the end (30~ min) and I can hardly pay attention.  But I don't know if I would be "warmed up" well enough if I just started off listening.

Also, as for Christianese, I think that part of that is really just rituals.  I remember when I was a kid and I would do communion I always prayed these certain phrases (along with other things too) and mostly because they conveyed what I meant as well as sound cool.  Now it's a lot more raw, but with the same emotion.  I figure that some Christianese it's ok, because like you said GOAT, it works, it's just not original.  And that works for some people; my brother Walt one time was looking online for a poem to send to his girlfriend where I would never do that since I'd just write it myself.  But original is definitely better.

I'll have to pay attention for the top one to see if I notice that.  It's an interesting theory but I am not yet convinced.

So I had another epiphany about it on the way home from school yesterday.  So, we tend to think of prayer as just talking to God (bear with me if you disagree) and as I was thinking about what frew was saying, I asked God what He thought about it and immediately He impressed upon me Esther and Nehamiah, where they brought desires, questions, and requests before the King.  Basically a laundry list of things, prerehearsed to some extent.  And it made me realize that prayer is a combination of both talking with God as a friend and coming before the almighty King with petitions.. anyways, it made  alittle more sense after that.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 21:56, 13 September 2008 (UTC)
