You have all noticed how odd it is to hear "religious" people pray vs people who really know God.  So I thought I would note a couple of things God has been showing me about prayer.  Mostly it's just been because I've been comparing how we talk to people vs how we talk to God.

Inccessent use of "God, Lord, Jesus:"   So you've all heard people, "Lord, we praise you, Lord we love you, Lord we want to see you" The prayee who uses a name of God about once every sentence.  So where do we see this in normal life?  I think it's most common when you think the other person really isn't listening.  Think of a little kid, "Daddy can you help me, daddy can we watch tv, daddy please."  It's as though the other side of the conversation is busy and not really paying attention.  However, when you talk to someone face to face and they are obviously paying attention you never need to reference them in coversation because it's obvious by eye and face contact that they're paying attention.  In my  opinion this illustrates practical "lack of faith"  where we "believe" that God cares about our prayers, but really deep down, we think He's deffinetly up there, He just doesn't give a rip.  More or less the superflurous use of His name demonstrates we dont' believe He's listening.

Christianese:  I've also been thinking about the semantics of how we pray, it's like a different language that no one else uses.  And really one we don't understand all that well.  I guess you could compare it to when you don't actually know a coding language, but you have a couple of examples so you just string together bits and pieces you've heard in a way to kinda say what you want.  But because you don't really get it it's basically junk.  And after a while you should learn to replace those prepackaged pieces of code wiht stuff you acutally understand and wrote.  Specifically I was thinking of how we use praise as a verb.   I never use praise as a verb, I use adjectives I understand to exalt someone and by doing so give them praise.  Ex:  I praise you frew for your tea selection vs  Frew that tea you picked is freaking awesome, you da man.  The first uses the word praise, the second actually results in someone being praised.  The same could be said about blessing, and lots of other christian words that I don't actually understand or use....

Waiting to listen:  This is the one i've been struggling with the most, and it makes sense I suppose.  So if you pray through the "Lord's Prayer"  after a while it feels like a laundry list, this in my opinion is because if you talk to a person for 20 minutes without allowing them to say anything in response, you might as well be giving a presentation.  It just makes me wonder about it, I mean "coming before the Lord" could mean a prewritten speech of requests, but it should also mean just talking, which is two way... hmm.. no conclusions yet..

What do you guys think?
