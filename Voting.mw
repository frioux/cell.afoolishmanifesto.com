>== '''Get out the Vote''' ==

Elections are just one week away... should this be a serious issue for Christians? A couple of questions to consider. Please answer BOTH questions, regardless of which candidate you plan on supporting. I will post my answers after there's a few other answers up.

1. As a Christian, why should you vote for McCain/Palin?

2. As a Christian, why should you vote for Obama/Biden?

I am going to generalize this for Republican and Democrat; hope that's not a problem.  (Also I don't plan on voting for either and think this is a straw dog.)

1. As a Christian we should vote R because voting R will lead to less legal sinning.

2. As a Christian we should vote D because voting D will not force our morality and Christianity is about choice.  Furthermore we would be helping the poor more by raising taxes and giving some of that money to the poor.

3. I am going to add my own bullet because I think both of those choices are wrong and that the president will not actually make a difference: as a Christian I believe that we should be non-partisan voters who pay a significant amount of attention to local elections.  Local elections can lead to more good that we can measure and if we are so lead we can participate in the local arena.  Furthermore I believe in a more libertarian national government, (neither D or R), which would let states do more.  I think that the national government should not have to help the poor.  I think that's the churches job and I don't think that as a Christian I should ask non-Christians to help the poor.  I have a good reason to help the poor.  If they have a reason let them help the poor, but I don't want to force them to help the poor or force them to be moral or force them to be Christians.  That is a personal choice.  So basically I am saying that you should vote either one for president (I don't think it will matter!) and do your research for local stuff and for Senate and Congress.

As Sparky is apt to point out, i am fairly opinionated.  That being said...

1.  McCain/Palin make a good team and seem to be on the same page.  The one supports the other, etc.  They stand for most of the values i hold.  Obama lies when it would be easier to tell the truth and defend his actions.  His character and those of his wife and pastor (i know he disowned his pastor, that doesn't change his attendance record) speak of racism, hatred, and traitorism to America.  Even Obama's running mate doesn't believe he is fully equipped to be leader of our nation and supports McCain in debates (and would probably not be a very good President, should the occasion arise.)  A &quot;smaller gov&quot; would mean more net income and allow more altruistic programs to be implemented in a state-by-state basis, leaving room for adaptation to needs.  No killing babies, probably no embryonic stem cell research (somatic stem cells are much less harmful.) And healthcare would not be socialized and sucky. (wretched plan of the Ds, and even worse for oklahoma!) 

2.  The democrats are more altruistic than Rs tend to be.  Many of the programs they favor would be excellent in practice, like those for the poor (not the educational &quot;no child left behind&quot; though.)  &quot;Larger gov&quot; would mean a decrease in national debt, hopefully.  Scientific advancement (whatever the cost.) Going green.

I think it is a very serious question for Christians.  We are called to be involved in our communities and to take responsibility for guiding the future of wherever-we-are.  Here, that means voting when you have the chance.  It also means selecting leaders who will lead the nation in whatever sort of work you believe in...like caring for the poor and giving ADEQUATE and PROMPT healthcare to those who need it, regardless of the cost, and caring for widows and orphans and caring for our planet and protecting our nation from war and destruction.  --[[User:Calli|Calli]]  23:17, 28 October 2008 (OUHSC)


Interesting perspective Frew.  I almost didn't post anything at all, but I think I will anyways.  While Calli C might be very opinionated, I am rather not.  I'm not voting, because I have not spent the time research/follow any of the campaigns, and think it is ridiculous to vote uneducated (I also forgot to get an absentee ballet).  Why haven't I followed it?  Initially because of time, and now a bit of apathy.  I've never been much on politics, and have never really been convicted about it.  I've always said that I would do more as far as keeping up on politics/news when I graduate, but I'm not there yet.  

Also, I think part of one of my problems is my default view of administrations and organizations.  I tend to be a bit pissed off at them and want to rebel in general from them.  I think this is somewhat a product of my recent educational experiences.  Comments?  Suggestions from graduated LU engineers?

1) ?

2) ?

So I think I have thought at one point or another like each of the posts, but I think i've ended up like sparky.  Being a christian we are called to support and respect the king, well, in democracy, we're the king, so we need to do our part.  However, being totally divorced from the outside world for a while (engineering school) and i've discovered it hasn't changed much.   My experience recently is that the american democracy is broken, we hvae turned into a two party system which is totally polar, unfortunately I am on both sides of the fence, I agree with the democrats on isseus like technology, the environment, foreign policy, and taxes.  However, I agree with the republicans on issues like marriage, human life, and bio-issues.  So in a time like this where do I stand?  Squarely in the, I chose to vote third party, in both this election and last election, this year i voted for stephen colbert actually, i didn't like any of the real third parties, so I voted for a farse.  I think as a citizen whose values and views are not being addressed by a current political party I should send a message that this two aprty system is dumb.   And, to people that tell me that I am throwing my vote away, I say that every vote is important, and I choose to not support one of those parties that I can't agree with.  So, as a christian, I say be revolutionary, vote for somebody you want vs the lesser of two evils...

You guys can't forget the signature...  Anyway, I talked to one of the guys at work and he pointed out something that his pastor said about Voting in general.  You basically, as a Christian, have three reasons to vote:

# Doctrine
# Conviction
# Opinion

Doctrine says that we are citizens of heaven.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't vote, it just means that we have a higher government or authority.  Conviction is personal and maybe corporate.  In that it means that Christ may tell me to vote for one person for mayor and tell you to vote for someone else.  The only time that I can tell you to vote for my convictions is if I have authority over you; ie if you are my kids or congregation or something like that (maybe...) And then of course opinion is last of all and is entirely up to you.  The point is that great damage can be done when conviction or opinion are made into doctrine.  Anyway, I hope that makes sense to you guys; I thought it was really insightful.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 03:26, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

Good responses all... Now I'm going to &quot;refine&quot; my questions a little bit, and throw in my answers. What I was trying to get at is this - imagine that you are a Christian who is a citizen of some other country than the United States. LOTS of things that the next president will affect WON'T affect you... taxes, for instance. The size of government. But, foreign policy will. And you also care about the poor, the widow, the orphan, the innocent child. So you want to vote in their interest. 

I recently read a book called &quot;Jesus For President,&quot; which has two main points. First of all, that the idea that there is one candidate who is &quot;God's candidate&quot; for the White House is a lie from Hell. The second point is that this idea, in a way, calls us to place our heavenly citizenship subordinate to our earthly citizenship. If my voting one way can bring about greater good for my neighbor and my enemy, even if it is at my expense, then I should vote that way.

Calli C, your responses seem more &quot;political&quot; than &quot;spiritual.&quot;
Goat, you copped out.
fREW, while I agree with you in large part, local politicians don't have much effect on America's role in the rest of the world. There are millions in Iraq who believe that our war over there is a Christian war. Like a replay of the crusades. Your vote on the national level affects the well-being of your brother in Christ who does not live in America, and of your enemy, whom you are called to love.

So here are my thoughts on the question.

1. Why should a Christian vote for McCain/Palin? 

McCain knows that American needs to scale down the war in Iraq, but he has not blindly committed to a &quot;pull-out&quot; date which could result in situation like we have in Afghanistan - where our former allies (Bin Laden) become our enemies because we stop caring about them. His policies here could potentially be better for Iraqis than Obama's

McCain believes, as I do, and as I feel scripture teaches, that life begins at conception. This should affect how he decides policy on abortion. 

McCain is a strong believer in the integrity of the family. Policy decisions should reflect this belief, for the benefit of the institution of the family in America.

2. Why should a Christian vote for Obama/Biden?

Obama has stated that while he is pro-choice, he longs for a world where abortion does not exist. In this effort, he worked with the Democratic party to add a statement to the party platform calling for abortion reduction. Studies have shown that Democratic economic policies (child support, family planning education, unemployment for pregnant women, etc) has a significant (up to 30%) effect on the abortion rate. Republican legal policies (parental notification or permission) have a negligible effect on the abortion rate. Furthermore, as with gay marriage, abortion is now a state-level issue. So, while nation-wide economic policy has great potential to lower the abortion rate, nation-wide legal policy cannot, because it is not a federal-level issue.

While Obama's position on the war in Iraq may result in problems, his foreign policy generally calls for less military intervention and more foreign aid. The fact that America believes itself to be a Christian nation (85% of the population calling themselves Christian) is undeniable, and the world believes this as well. Obama's foreign policy would be more &quot;friendly&quot; and more popular worldwide. Christianity's reputation has been tarnished by the actions of our &quot;Christian&quot; president. Both of the current candidates claim to be Christian, and I feel that Obama's foreign policy would look and feel more Christian to the rest of the world (though personally I don't think the commander-in-chief of any military can actually be Christian, but that is a thought for another page).

Yes, it is the church's responsibility to care for the poor and the sick. Is the church doing this? What if the church voted in a government which cared for the poor and the sick?

We are called to be stewards of the environment. Obama's policies make this a more clear priority than McCain's do.

In closing, let me state that because I don't believe God has &quot;a man for the white house,&quot; I really don't &quot;like&quot; either of these candidates. There has only ever been one government which God approved of - Israel's theocracy. If I were to write someone in on the ballot, I'd write in &quot;God.&quot; (Maybe YHWH to make sure there was no confusion. I should learn to write that in Hebrew.)

[[User:Lshave|Lshave]] 15:48, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

So my pastor had a pretty powerful point this last sunday but I thouhgt I'd wait until after the election to post it.  He mentioned that there are pretty powerful reasons to vote for either canidate from the &quot;christian perspective&quot; and thus there are all kinds of rabid fans on both sides of the debate.  And what's more this isn't a bad thing, it's good to take this stuff seriously, and it's good we have different viewpoints in the body of Christ from idealists like myself who want something different than the two current parties and &quot;throw their vote away&quot; on third parties.  People who support the republicans whose basic values are often very close to christian values.  People who support the democrats who often act more like christians, and all the other views.  

But really when it all comes down to it, Romans is very clear when it says we need to respect and pray for our leaders.  So today now that the votes are in, now that it's over, we need to pray for our leader and respect their authority.  We shouldn't be the braggers, or the whiners, we need to act like christians, not like politicians.  I know that was very convicting for me because I have often been very critical of the current administration, and vocal too, but really, while I could disagree with their decisions or policies, I still need to respect them, I still need to pray for them, I still need to humbly accept their authority.  This is pretty basic, accepting those in authority, from parents to employers to government.  We have no problems accepting authority from poeple we agree with or like (like my parents) but we have a hard time accepting authority of people we think are dumb, or jerks... (imagine christians during the roman period.) 

When it comes down to it, I hope for this new president, that I can act more like a christian towards him than I did towards the last one.  Whether it's easy or not.  Thoughts?  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:16, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

I agree and have nothing to add.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 18:47, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

I agree.  My church hunt has added praying for the govermnet a daily thing for me (they do it).  They only thing that I have to add, considering I like Hebrew much better than poplitics, is יהןה is the way to spell YHWH.[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 20:17, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

OK, I'm late to this page, but I thought I'd throw some thoughts in. First, I definitely agree about praying for our leaders - I need to do that more for our current leaders and the new ones that just got voted in. Second, I didn't like Obama's policies at all, and there was plenty in McCain that I disagreed with as well, but I thought McCain was better than Obama.

Do you all follow third parties much? I disagree strongly with Libertarians on abortion (they tend to be pro-choice). But, the Constitution Party has a platform that I agree with almost in its entirety (and it doesn't look at all like modern America :). I couldn't vote for Chuck Baldwin, but if I could have, I would have been very tempted to as a statement of what my beliefs are.

I definitely disagree with not voting at all, or with just writing someone in who's not actually running. I think in this country, voting gives us one opportunity to be salt and light in society (eg. work against legalized murder).

As far as abortion goes as an issue, I think we should be going beyond far parental notification and permission, to make it illegal again. That's the goal. Roe v Wade was a farse and should be overturned. Democrats tend to be strongly pro-choice, and Republicans pro-life (I know there are exceptions, but look at the party platforms). That gives me a strong reason to vote Republican in many races, because I do think that abortion trumps a good number of other issues. I disagree that it's a state-level issue, too. It was the activist Supreme Court that created the right to kill your children, so it needs to be overturned at a federal level. (Gay marriage has not been created at the federal level, so there is a difference.)

Caring for the poor can be a tough issue. I strongly believe that we shouldn't be voting for a small government that doesn't care for people, without being responsible ourselves to give and help others. I think church ministries that do exist are a great way to help others. There are myriad private Christian charities to investigate and donate to, as well. This way, people can hear the Gospel as they are helped physically.

Just another side of the issue of welfare: I think the government programs have done great damage to society, even as they try to help (sorry, I don't have numbers and stats, ...). A woman receives much more help if she is unmarried, so why not live with a boyfriend who works, so that she gets government help and another income? If she has another child, she gets more money. This encourages the destruction of family in society. These systems get abused so badly - I think if it's done by the church or another organization at a local level, there can be much more accountability. Just another issue about government abuses even at the city/county level - I heard on the radio about school lunches being abused by people who weren't supposed to get them.

Finally (last issue for now), I don't think socialism works. If I can get free money from the government and I'm not a Christian, why should I work at all? People do just sit around and take the handouts. If I'm going to work really hard and earn lots of money, but then the governments going to take away my money, why would I do that? Obama's stated goals are to soak the rich and give to the poor. In fact, his &quot;tax cut for 95% of Americans&quot; claim? 40-50% of Americans *already* don't pay income tax! But they're going to get this refund anyway - this is pure redistribution of wealth, and I don't like it.

OK, there's my 2 cents on a few issues. I hope it's coherent. --[[benjie|benjie]]


I realize this is a little late, but i saw this on slashdot the other day and thought it was pretty awesome: 

Barroom Economics 
This is real life math to understand our tax system.

Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:

The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.
The fifth would pay $1.
The sixth would pay $3.
The seventh would pay $7.
The eighth would pay $12.
The ninth would pay $18.
The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.

So, that's what they decided to do.

The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. &quot;Since you are all such good customers,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.&quot; Drinks for the ten now cost just $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free.


But what about the other six men - the paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share?'

They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay. And so:

The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).
The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33%savings).
The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).
The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).
The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).
The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).

Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.

&quot;I only got a dollar out of the $20,&quot; declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man,&quot; but he got $10!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that's right,&quot; exclaimed the fifth man. &quot;I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than I!&quot;

&quot;That's true!!&quot; shouted the seventh man. &quot;Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; yelled the first four men in unison. &quot;We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!&quot;

The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.

The next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!

And that, ladies and gentlemen, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.
