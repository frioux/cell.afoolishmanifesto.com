Elections are just one week away... should this be a serious issue for Christians? A couple of questions to consider. Please answer BOTH questions, regardless of which candidate you plan on supporting. I will post my answers after there's a few other answers up.

1. As a Christian, why should you vote for McCain/Palin?

2. As a Christian, why should you vote for Obama/Biden?
