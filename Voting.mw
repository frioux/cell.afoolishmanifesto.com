== '''Get out the Vote''' ==

Elections are just one week away... should this be a serious issue for Christians? A couple of questions to consider. Please answer BOTH questions, regardless of which candidate you plan on supporting. I will post my answers after there's a few other answers up.

1. As a Christian, why should you vote for McCain/Palin?

2. As a Christian, why should you vote for Obama/Biden?

I am going to generalize this for Republican and Democrat; hope that's not a problem.  (Also I don't plan on voting for either and think this is a straw dog.)

1. As a Christian we should vote R because voting R will lead to less legal sinning.

2. As a Christian we should vote D because voting D will not force our morality and Christianity is about choice.  Furthermore we would be helping the poor more by raising taxes and giving some of that money to the poor.

3. I am going to add my own bullet because I think both of those choices are wrong and that the president will not actually make a difference: as a Christian I believe that we should be non-partisan voters who pay a significant amount of attention to local elections.  Local elections can lead to more good that we can measure and if we are so lead we can participate in the local arena.  Furthermore I believe in a more libertarian national government, (neither D or R), which would let states do more.  I think that the national government should not have to help the poor.  I think that's the churches job and I don't think that as a Christian I should ask non-Christians to help the poor.  I have a good reason to help the poor.  If they have a reason let them help the poor, but I don't want to force them to help the poor or force them to be moral or force them to be Christians.  That is a personal choice.  So basically I am saying that you should vote either one for president (I don't think it will matter!) and do your research for local stuff and for Senate and Congress.

As Sparky is apt to point out, i am fairly opinionated.  That being said...

1.  McCain/Palin make a good team and seem to be on the same page.  The one supports the other, etc.  They stand for most of the values i hold.  Obama lies when it would be easier to tell the truth and defend his actions.  His character and those of his wife and pastor (i know he disowned his pastor, that doesn't change his attendance record) speak of racism, hatred, and traitorism to America.  Even Obama's running mate doesn't believe he is fully equipped to be leader of our nation and supports McCain in debates (and would probably not be a very good President, should the occasion arise.)  A "smaller gov" would mean more net income and allow more altruistic programs to be implemented in a state-by-state basis, leaving room for adaptation to needs.  No killing babies, probably no embryonic stem cell research (somatic stem cells are much less harmful.) And healthcare would not be socialized and sucky. (wretched plan of the Ds, and even worse for oklahoma!) 

2.  The democrats are more altruistic than Rs tend to be.  Many of the programs they favor would be excellent in practice, like those for the poor (not the educational "no child left behind" though.)  "Larger gov" would mean a decrease in national debt, hopefully.  Scientific advancement (whatever the cost.) Going green.

I think it is a very serious question for Christians.  We are called to be involved in our communities and to take responsibility for guiding the future of wherever-we-are.  Here, that means voting when you have the chance.  It also means selecting leaders who will lead the nation in whatever sort of work you believe in...like caring for the poor and giving ADEQUATE and PROMPT healthcare to those who need it, regardless of the cost, and caring for widows and orphans and caring for our planet and protecting our nation from war and destruction.  --[[User:Calli|Calli]]  23:17, 28 October 2008 (OUHSC)


Interesting perspective Frew.  I almost didn't post anything at all, but I think I will anyways.  While Calli C might be very opinionated, I am rather not.  I'm not voting, because I have not spent the time research/follow any of the campaigns, and think it is ridiculous to vote uneducated (I also forgot to get an absentee ballet).  Why haven't I followed it?  Initially because of time, and now a bit of apathy.  I've never been much on politics, and have never really been convicted about it.  I've always said that I would do more as far as keeping up on politics/news when I graduate, but I'm not there yet.  

Also, I think part of one of my problems is my default view of administrations and organizations.  I tend to be a bit pissed off at them and want to rebel in general from them.  I think this is somewhat a product of my recent educational experiences.  Comments?  Suggestions from graduated LU engineers?

1) ?

2) ?
