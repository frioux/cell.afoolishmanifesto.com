== '''Get out the Vote''' ==

Elections are just one week away... should this be a serious issue for Christians? A couple of questions to consider. Please answer BOTH questions, regardless of which candidate you plan on supporting. I will post my answers after there's a few other answers up.

1. As a Christian, why should you vote for McCain/Palin?

2. As a Christian, why should you vote for Obama/Biden?

I am going to generalize this for Republican and Democrat; hope that's not a problem.  (Also I don't plan on voting for either and think this is a straw dog.)

1. As a Christian we should vote R because voting R will lead to less legal sinning.

2. As a Christian we should vote D because voting D will not force our morality and Christianity is about choice.  Furthermore we would be helping the poor more by raising taxes and giving some of that money to the poor.

3. I am going to add my own bullet because I think both of those choices are wrong and that the president will not actually make a difference: as a Christian I believe that we should be non-partisan voters who pay a significant amount of attention to local elections.  Local elections can lead to more good that we can measure and if we are so lead we can participate in the local arena.  Furthermore I believe in a more libertarian national government, (neither D or R), which would let states do more.  I think that the national government should not have to help the poor.  I think that's the churches job and I don't think that as a Christian I should ask non-Christians to help the poor.  I have a good reason to help the poor.  If they have a reason let them help the poor, but I don't want to force them to help the poor or force them to be moral or force them to be Christians.  That is a personal choice.  So basically I am saying that you should vote either one for president (I don't think it will matter!) and do your research for local stuff and for Senate and Congress.

As Sparky is apt to point out, i am fairly opinionated.  That being said...

1.  McCain/Palin make a good team and seem to be on the same page.  The one supports the other, etc.  They stand for most of the values i hold.  Obama lies when it would be easier to tell the truth and defend his actions.  His character and those of his wife and pastor (i know he disowned his pastor, that doesn't change his attendance record) speak of racism, hatred, and traitorism to America.  Even Obama's running mate doesn't believe he is fully equipped to be leader of our nation and supports McCain in debates (and would probably not be a very good President, should the occasion arise.)  A "smaller gov" would mean more net income and allow more altruistic programs to be implemented in a state-by-state basis, leaving room for adaptation to needs.  No killing babies, probably no embryonic stem cell research (somatic stem cells are much less harmful.) And healthcare would not be socialized and sucky. (wretched plan of the Ds, and even worse for oklahoma!) 

2.  The democrats are more altruistic than Rs tend to be.  Many of the programs they favor would be excellent in practice, like those for the poor (not the educational "no child left behind" though.)  "Larger gov" would mean a decrease in national debt, hopefully.  Scientific advancement (whatever the cost.) Going green.

I think it is a very serious question for Christians.  We are called to be involved in our communities and to take responsibility for guiding the future of wherever-we-are.  Here, that means voting when you have the chance.  It also means selecting leaders who will lead the nation in whatever sort of work you believe in...like caring for the poor and giving ADEQUATE and PROMPT healthcare to those who need it, regardless of the cost, and caring for widows and orphans and caring for our planet and protecting our nation from war and destruction.  --[[User:Calli|Calli]]  23:17, 28 October 2008 (OUHSC)


Interesting perspective Frew.  I almost didn't post anything at all, but I think I will anyways.  While Calli C might be very opinionated, I am rather not.  I'm not voting, because I have not spent the time research/follow any of the campaigns, and think it is ridiculous to vote uneducated (I also forgot to get an absentee ballet).  Why haven't I followed it?  Initially because of time, and now a bit of apathy.  I've never been much on politics, and have never really been convicted about it.  I've always said that I would do more as far as keeping up on politics/news when I graduate, but I'm not there yet.  

Also, I think part of one of my problems is my default view of administrations and organizations.  I tend to be a bit pissed off at them and want to rebel in general from them.  I think this is somewhat a product of my recent educational experiences.  Comments?  Suggestions from graduated LU engineers?

1) ?

2) ?

So I think I have thought at one point or another like each of the posts, but I think i've ended up like sparky.  Being a christian we are called to support and respect the king, well, in democracy, we're the king, so we need to do our part.  However, being totally divorced from the outside world for a while (engineering school) and i've discovered it hasn't changed much.   My experience recently is that the american democracy is broken, we hvae turned into a two party system which is totally polar, unfortunately I am on both sides of the fence, I agree with the democrats on isseus like technology, the environment, foreign policy, and taxes.  However, I agree with the republicans on issues like marriage, human life, and bio-issues.  So in a time like this where do I stand?  Squarely in the, I chose to vote third party, in both this election and last election, this year i voted for stephen colbert actually, i didn't like any of the real third parties, so I voted for a farse.  I think as a citizen whose values and views are not being addressed by a current political party I should send a message that this two aprty system is dumb.   And, to people that tell me that I am throwing my vote away, I say that every vote is important, and I choose to not support one of those parties that I can't agree with.  So, as a christian, I say be revolutionary, vote for somebody you want vs the lesser of two evils...

You guys can't forget the signature...  Anyway, I talked to one of the guys at work and he pointed out something that his pastor said about Voting in general.  You basically, as a Christian, have three reasons to vote:

# Doctrine
# Conviction
# Opinion

Doctrine says that we are citizens of heaven.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't vote, it just means that we have a higher government or authority.  Conviction is personal and maybe corporate.  In that it means that Christ may tell me to vote for one person for mayor and tell you to vote for someone else.  The only time that I can tell you to vote for my convictions is if I have authority over you; ie if you are my kids or congregation or something like that (maybe...) And then of course opinion is last of all and is entirely up to you.  The point is that great damage can be done when conviction or opinion are made into doctrine.  Anyway, I hope that makes sense to you guys; I thought it was really insightful.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 03:26, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

Good responses all... Now I'm going to "refine" my questions a little bit, and throw in my answers. What I was trying to get at is this - imagine that you are a Christian who is a citizen of some other country than the United States. LOTS of things that the next president will affect WON'T affect you... taxes, for instance. The size of government. But, foreign policy will. And you also care about the poor, the widow, the orphan, the innocent child. So you want to vote in their interest. 

I recently read a book called "Jesus For President," which has two main points. First of all, that the idea that there is one candidate who is "God's candidate" for the White House is a lie from Hell. The second point is that this idea, in a way, calls us to place our heavenly citizenship subordinate to our earthly citizenship. If my voting one way can bring about greater good for my neighbor and my enemy, even if it is at my expense, then I should vote that way.

Calli C, your responses seem more "political" than "spiritual."
Goat, you copped out.
fREW, while I agree with you in large part, local politicians don't have much effect on America's role in the rest of the world. There are millions in Iraq who believe that our war over there is a Christian war. Like a replay of the crusades. Your vote on the national level affects the well-being of your brother in Christ who does not live in America, and of your enemy, whom you are called to love.

So here are my thoughts on the question.

1. Why should a Christian vote for McCain/Palin? 

McCain knows that American needs to scale down the war in Iraq, but he has not blindly committed to a "pull-out" date which could result in situation like we have in Afghanistan - where our former allies (Bin Laden) become our enemies because we stop caring about them. His policies here could potentially be better for Iraqis than Obama's

McCain believes, as I do, and as I feel scripture teaches, that life begins at conception. This should affect how he decides policy on abortion. 

McCain is a strong believer in the integrity of the family. Policy decisions should reflect this belief, for the benefit of the institution of the family in America.

2. Why should a Christian vote for Obama/Biden?

Obama has stated that while he is pro-choice, he longs for a world where abortion does not exist. In this effort, he worked with the Democratic party to add a statement to the party platform calling for abortion reduction. Studies have shown that Democratic economic policies (child support, family planning education, unemployment for pregnant women, etc) has a significant (up to 30%) effect on the abortion rate. Republican legal policies (parental notification or permission) have a negligible effect on the abortion rate. Furthermore, as with gay marriage, abortion is now a state-level issue. So, while nation-wide economic policy has great potential to lower the abortion rate, nation-wide legal policy cannot, because it is not a federal-level issue.

While Obama's position on the war in Iraq may result in problems, his foreign policy generally calls for less military intervention and more foreign aid. The fact that America believes itself to be a Christian nation (85% of the population calling themselves Christian) is undeniable, and the world believes this as well. Obama's foreign policy would be more "friendly" and more popular worldwide. Christianity's reputation has been tarnished by the actions of our "Christian" president. Both of the current candidates claim to be Christian, and I feel that Obama's foreign policy would look and feel more Christian to the rest of the world (though personally I don't think the commander-in-chief of any military can actually be Christian, but that is a thought for another page).

Yes, it is the church's responsibility to care for the poor and the sick. Is the church doing this? What if the church voted in a government which cared for the poor and the sick?

We are called to be stewards of the environment. Obama's policies make this a more clear priority than McCain's do.

In closing, let me state that because I don't believe God has "a man for the white house," I really don't "like" either of these candidates. There has only ever been one government which God approved of - Israel's theocracy. If I were to write someone in on the ballot, I'd write in "God." (Maybe YHWH to make sure there was no confusion. I should learn to write that in Hebrew.)

So my pastor had a pretty powerful point this last sunday but I thouhgt I'd wait until after the election to post it.  He mentioned that there are pretty powerful reasons to vote for either canidate from the "christian perspective" and thus there are all kinds of rabid fans on both sides of the debate.  And what's more this isn't a bad thing, it's good to take this stuff seriously, and it's good we have different viewpoints in the body of Christ from idealists like myself who want something different than the two current parties and "throw their vote away" on third parties.  People who support the republicans whose basic values are often very close to christian values.  People who support the democrats who often act more like christians, and all the other views.  

But really when it all comes down to it, Romans is very clear when it says we need to respect and pray for our leaders.  So today now that the votes are in, now that it's over, we need to pray for our leader and respect their authority.  We shouldn't be the braggers, or the whiners, we need to act like christians, not like politicians.  I know that was very convicting for me because I have often been very critical of the current administration, and vocal too, but really, while I could disagree with their decisions or policies, I still need to respect them, I still need to pray for them, I still need to humbly accept their authority.  This is pretty basic, accepting those in authority, from parents to employers to government.  We have no problems accepting authority from poeple we agree with or like (like my parents) but we have a hard time accepting authority of people we think are dumb, or jerks... (imagine christians during the roman period.) 

When it comes down to it, I hope for this new president, that I can act more like a christian towards him than I did towards the last one.  Whether it's easy or not.  Thoughts?  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:16, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

I agree and have nothing to add.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 18:47, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
