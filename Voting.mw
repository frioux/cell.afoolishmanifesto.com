== '''Get out the Vote''' ==

Elections are just one week away... should this be a serious issue for Christians? A couple of questions to consider. Please answer BOTH questions, regardless of which candidate you plan on supporting. I will post my answers after there's a few other answers up.

1. As a Christian, why should you vote for McCain/Palin?

2. As a Christian, why should you vote for Obama/Biden?

I am going to generalize this for Republican and Democrat; hope that's not a problem.  (Also I don't plan on voting for either and think this is a straw dog.)

1. As a Christian we should vote R because voting R will lead to less legal sinning.

2. As a Christian we should vote D because voting D will not force our morality and Christianity is about choice.  Furthermore we would be helping the poor more by raising taxes and giving some of that money to the poor.

3. I am going to add my own bullet because I think both of those choices are wrong and that the president will not actually make a difference: as a Christian I believe that we should be non-partisan voters who pay a significant amount of attention to local elections.  Local elections can lead to more good that we can measure and if we are so lead we can participate in the local arena.  Furthermore I believe in a more libertarian national government, (neither D or R), which would let states do more.  I think that the national government should not have to help the poor.  I think that's the churches job and I don't think that as a Christian I should ask non-Christians to help the poor.  I have a good reason to help the poor.  If they have a reason let them help the poor, but I don't want to force them to help the poor or force them to be moral or force them to be Christians.  That is a personal choice.  So basically I am saying that you should vote either one for president (I don't think it will matter!) and do your research for local stuff and for Senate and Congress.
