So, it was around midterms for me during my second semester of graduate school.  I had just really bombed a test, Becci was working two jobs and totally stressed and it was raining...

I can remember many times at LeTourneau where the walk back from the machine tool lab late at night/early in the morning was a tremendous spiritual experience, the peace of God flowing over you and your exhaustion fading to weariness and finally the sweet sweet sleep at the end of the walk.  And so as I finished up my work at school here at RPI (around 6:30 or so) it was getting dark and raining and I needed to go home.  I was pretty downtrodden and stressed, exhausted and really lacking in the motivation department.  At LU it was never quite the same because I knew I needed to graduate to get a job and such, but motivation for graduate school is different, because I could just go get a high paying job and have an easy life. I turned down a ride from a friend and began the 20 minute walk home and started to pray.  Dusk was gradually falling and rain was steadily falling on my head.  All I could talk to God about was my troubles, why was I hear, why was this so hard, what was I doing, where was he at, I felt pretty low.  It wasn't an angry prayer, just a depressed, tired, and most of all beaten, prayer.  

About 10 minutes into the walk I felt the heaviness lift and I remembered why I was here.  God had given me a passion for the things I was studying, and whats more a passion to teach them to others.  The reason I came to graduate school was because I see Gods power, grace, and beauty in materials and mechanism and micrographs.  And as I looked around I marvelled at the hybrid ionic-covalent bonds holding together bricks, the electron band gap that made my eyes perceive them as red.  The cellulous and ligin structure that makes up the sweeping trees, the surface tension and wind forces that shape rain drops.  The fact that all of these evoke an emotional response from me, on and on I marvelled at Gods creation.  And I transitioned to praise for the beauty of his works.  

Finally I got the the subject of food and was aboslutly blown away by the fact a bean or leaf grown on the opposite side of the globe could be processed just so and brewed into a drink that tasted so delectable to my tongue and made me happy.  How could such a think happen, the statistics of it were amazing.  Next I thought about chocolate and how it was ridicuouls that a bean grown in south america could be roasted to perfection, ground and masterfully mixed with a select blend of milk, sugar and others by someone in switzerland into a bar that was freaking amazingly delicious.  In fact I mentioned to God that I could really use a nice bar of dark Lindt chocolate, and I continued to walk.  By the time I got home, I was thoroughly wet and refreshed and I noticed a small box in front of my door.  

Apparently my mother thought it would be a good time to send me a package, and as I opened it standing in the entry way to my aparment, on the very top of all of my welding journals, credit card statments and bank notes, was a bar of lindt dark chocolate.
