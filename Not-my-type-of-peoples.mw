So, I'm learning a good deal about legit Christianity (in other words, I'm being convicted like mad and seeing how super nasty I am).  So, were supposed to love God and people, and I'm really struggling with the second half.  So there's 2 gnarly Christians at work.  They're my type of people.  I like them and they like me.  So what good is that?  Not much, or at least that's Jesus' viewpoint (Luke 6:32-36).  There's some not-my-type-of-peoples at work.  I'm having problems, because I believe that God cares more about how I view and treat the  not-my-type-of-peoples than how many academic commentaries I read.  I just finished reading “Blue like Jazz.”  Crazy book.  He talked alot about changing from looking down on people to loving them.  I have problems looking down on people.  I grew up around some really judgemental people who looked down on others, and I am trying/praying to overcome this.  For some reason my subconscience says that if someone is annoying me that they are a lesser person, or if someone keeps presenting himself in a way that bothers me, that he is less worthy of whatever.  Don says that he changed by really starting to learn to love that person.  The last several days I've been praying for 2 people, that i would love them unconditionally and not even have the desire to talk about them behind their backs because of something that I have deemed outragiously rediculous.  I don't feel like I am getting very far.  

Houston is full of some flavorful people.  My drive to and from work (and even the are that I live in) is full of needy people, the type of people that I discussed in the faith/works post that James talks about.  There's this dude that chills out at an intersection around 5pm.  He keeps a squigi and a water bottle full of washer fluid.  Sometimes he has flowers too.  One day I was first in the line at a red light and had my window down.  He proceeded to squirt my window with fluid and clean it.  I was offended.  He didn't even ask me, and I felt his intention was to put me in an awkward situation to get money.  I think my subconscience was thinking something to the effect that he should get off his lazy bum and be awesome like me and make some money.  I usually don't take that route, but I did again today.  When I saw him, I was ashamed of myself for getting in “his” lane again, but was thankful that the light turned green before he got to me.  On the weekends, you can see guys at the corners of the intersectios selling the Houston Cronicle.  I lack mercy towards them, and my heart is not right.  So, I think that I need to do something for those types of people.  I'm not sure what, but I need to reach out to the washer/flower guy.  I suck at what I taught this summer about loving the “less pretty” people, and that is what God wants most!  Have you guys been dealing with this sorta stuff?
