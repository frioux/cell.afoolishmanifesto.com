So, I'm learning a good deal about legit Christianity (in other words, I'm being convicted like mad and seeing how super nasty I am).  So, were supposed to love God and people, and I'm really struggling with the second half.  So there's 2 gnarly Christians at work.  They're my type of people.  I like them and they like me.  So what good is that?  Not much, or at least that's Jesus' viewpoint (Luke 6:32-36).  There's some not-my-type-of-peoples at work.  I'm having problems, because I believe that God cares more about how I view and treat the  not-my-type-of-peoples than how many academic commentaries I read.  I just finished reading “Blue like Jazz.”  Crazy book.  He talked alot about changing from looking down on people to loving them.  I have problems looking down on people.  I grew up around some really judgemental people who looked down on others, and I am trying/praying to overcome this.  For some reason my subconscience says that if someone is annoying me that they are a lesser person, or if someone keeps presenting himself in a way that bothers me, that he is less worthy of whatever.  Don says that he changed by really starting to learn to love that person.  The last several days I've been praying for 2 people, that i would love them unconditionally and not even have the desire to talk about them behind their backs because of something that I have deemed outrageously ridiculous.  I don't feel like I am getting very far.  

Houston is full of some flavorful people.  My drive to and from work (and even the area that I live in) is full of needy people, the type of people that I discussed in the faith/works post that James talks about.  There's this dude that chills out at an intersection around 5pm.  He keeps a squeegee and a water bottle full of washer fluid.  Sometimes he has flowers too.  One day I was first in the line at a red light and had my window down.  He proceeded to squirt my window with fluid and clean it.  I was offended.  He didn't even ask me, and I felt his intention was to put me in an awkward situation to get money.  I think my subconscious was thinking something to the effect that he should get off his lazy bum and be awesome like me and make some money.  I usually don't take that route, but I did again today.  When I saw him, I was ashamed of myself for getting in “his” lane again, but was thankful that the light turned green before he got to me.  On the weekends, you can see guys at the corners of the intersections selling the Houston Cronicle.  I lack mercy towards them, and my heart is not right.  So, I think that I need to do something for those types of people.  I'm not sure what, but I need to reach out to the washer/flower guy.  I suck at what I taught this summer about loving the “less pretty” people, and that is what God wants most!  Have you guys been dealing with this sorta stuff?

I don't know if I can say that I am convicted in the same way because I haven't been in those situations.  But I can say that I had an interesting perspective on that stuff while I was in Honduras.  Anyway, I remember one of the people there asking me how I was doing, but because of the situation and whatnot it was clear to me that they were asking just because "it was the right thing to do," as opposed to them actually (emotionally) caring.  I think that actions are good, but God doesn't care about actions, and ultimately people don't either; it's the heart that matter.

To make it more clear: yes, it's great if you give a guy a dollar because your god said to and it's great if you try to save his soul because your god said to; but that is a little offensive on its own.  What matters to him (I think) is if you care about him as a person and '''because of that''' you feed his body, heal his emotionally unstable heart with love, and try to help save his soul.

Those are just my thoughts though. --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 03:06, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

I wonder about the idea of "heart only" importance.  I by no means want to minimize them but at the same time I'm curious if the pendulum has swung too far the other way.  For instance, if I get a compassion international kid and sponser him for 10 years for the wrong reasons (say I was guilt tripped into it).  The "superficial" response is that it's good that you sponsered him regardless of your heart, the "deep" response says that only your heart's reasoning matters.  One minimizes intent, the other minimizes action.  But the kid still eats well and gets free school for 10 years.

Personally I think that the ideal response should be somewhere in the middle, it would be great if I was nice to people (not punching them in the face) all the time because I loved them like Christ does.  But regarless of my intent people would appreciate me being nice to them (not punching them in the face) whether I felt like it or not.  

Practically I find it comes down to a few simple (simple not easy) things. 

1: The closer I get to Jesus the easier this is (it's currently much easier to love people than it used to be but still not easy)

2: Often actions come before acceptance (if I'm nice to someone eventually I learn enough about them to find real reasons to be nice to them) (see note)

3: Actions help others while intent helps me. (money is money begrudged or not, and intent is good but usually it affects the giver rather than the givee)

4:  Generally its encouraging to look to the past to see how much less I suck now than seeing how much I suck now.  (I can ascribe 10% of my change to my effort and 100% to Gods grace, yes I see the error)

5: Always pretend I am the other person. (even to the point of emulating metal instability, remove yourself from the logical scientific intelligent mindset and pretend you are bubba.)

This is where I come down on the idea of Not-my-type-of-people, and to be honest being at LeTourneau prepared us poorly in this respect because it's a fairly homogenous group of people when compared to the outside world.  It's hard and it requires lots of prayer, and scripture and practice... but if I examine how much better I've gotten since I was a freshman in college. .. it's encouraging, if I examine how I am now. it's depressing, but thats mostly I can just see more clearly wih fewer sticks in my eye... anyways.. those are my thoughts.. --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:33, 4 February 2009 (UTC)
