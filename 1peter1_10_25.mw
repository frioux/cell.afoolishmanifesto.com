Blue (eternal/mystic) Questions:

In verse 12 it talks about how we have heard about the gospel through/by the holy spirit, think about that and be prepared to talk a little about it.

Look at the last phrase of verse 12, Think about the idea of "angels desiring to look at stuff"

Look up Leviticus 11:44, 45 and think about "Be holy for I am holy."  What would this mean to peters readers?

Verse 17 is pretty heavy, think about it, what does that say about our father? 

Think about "foreordained" and "foreknown" etc.  Be prepared to discuss the ramifications or these concepts, does foreknowledge remove free will?  

Compare 21 to 17, whats different?
