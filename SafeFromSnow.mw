So on Saturday, March 20th, 2010, it snowed in Dallas.  The following Sunday I got in my car and started the drive to Greenville, TX where Catherine lives, as I do every Sunday.  On the way there I was driving 70 miles an hour on 75 and I hit a patch of ice.  My car started to wobble and I did what any person who drives where it never snows would do: I slammed on my brakes!

If you don't already know the secret of driving on ice, I'll spoil the surprise for you: if you slam on your breaks while sliding your car will spin.  Mine did anyway.  I spun 180 degrees and slid into the lane to my right.  I was facing oncoming traffic moving 60 MPH backwards.  And then a truck hit the front of my car and I spun the rest of 180 degrees and slid to the next (furthest right) lane over.

I had stopped spinning and regained control of the car.

I pull over onto the shoulder to ensure the people in the truck that I hit were ok.  Everyone was safe including me.

That's already miracle category for me; there were lots of other cars (including an 18-wheeler) close by that could have turned that wreck into something a lot more serious.  But it gets better.  While the cops were on their way I got out of my car to inspect the damage...

My hood and bumper would definitely need to be replaced; but my radiator was fine and my headlights hadn't even been broken!  I got in a head on collision while I was moving at 70 miles an hour and the total repairs will probably cost between $1000 and $1500.

Awesome.
