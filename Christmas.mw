This is goats account of the first christmas:

From luke we know that the birth of John was announced to Zacharias before anything happened involving Jesus.  It is interesting to note the differences in the way that Mary and Zacharias took the news about children, we will get more into this later, but now the clock starts.  Elizabeth conceives and stays at home for 5 months.

Next in the 6th month Gabriel comes to Mary to announce that she is to bear the child of God even though she is a virgin.  She's probably around 16 and is engaged to a guy named Joseph who's probably a little older maybe mid-20s.  The first thing worth noting is the difference in the way that Mary responds to the angel, she first asks how this is even possible (she's not stupid) and then she vehemently proclaims that this is all totally awesome and she is proud to be Gods maidservant.  Compare this with Zacharias who responds by asking for a sign, perhaps just a little doubtful that this is possible (Abraham?).  It has been suggested that the mary responded appropriately by being excited and faithful, whereas Zacharias responded with doubt.  But I'd like to suggest that maybe we give mary a bit too much credit for her response.  (Note: the following is purely supposition, please don't hate me forever) I cannot account for the differences in cultures and times, but if you will inspect the standard teenage girl(or boy) you will notice they tend to be over-emotional and both headstrong (always right) and idealistic (my generation is going to do it right).  However, an older adult will most commonly be more circumspect, cautious, and skeptical about life.  So insert what we know generally about pychology into the story and look again at this idea that Mary was immediately gung ho for whatever, whereas Zacharias was a more cautious and skeptical.  I'm not going to declare that obvious Mary's response was to be expected of someone with her hormones and Zacharias's response was characteristic of a man with grey hair, but it is worth noting.  I think we tend to mythify people in the bible too much; they may have been extroidanary people, but they were still real people.  I think we can all remember times that we were excited to do something without fully understanding it's implications or consequences and it wasn't until later that we realized our error.  Again, I dont' want to minimize the faith required to say "yes Lord,"  but how much more faith is required when you fully understand the suffering and hardship to come.  Because I am not a theologian I'm not going to delve much deeper into the "right" course of action to be learned from this, but I think it's important to note how real people made decisions and their eventual consequences. 

Stay tuned for part II, Joseph find out!

(Hurray for RSS readers!)  Frew's 2 cents:  I'd just say that we '''are''' supposed to have faith like a child.  In that respect, yeah, it makes sense that a teenager would have more faith; and knowledge and wisdom regularly hinder faith.  I don't think that means we should have less knowledge, but we have to work to build our faith as we learn new things.  I don't want to sound like a Jesuit saying that I will deny science that I see if my faith differs from that.  I do think though that as our knowledge increases we need to get closer to God by spending more time with him.  Thoughts?  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 04:49, 22 October 2008 (UTC)


I totally agree that we '''are''' supposed to have faith like a child ( I mean it's word for word there) but what does that entail, does that entail faith from ignorance like a child has or something else, I think this is a pretty relevant issue with the intelligent design controversy.  Should we believe and follow Christ because we don't know any better, or should we rather put aside what we know to follow Him.  I think you could probably trace the roots to pride, the '''I know''' issue that infers my knowledge of life is superior to what God tells me whereas humility says maybe I'm wrong.  For instance, Zachariah says "how shall I know this" or really, "seriously, i'm pretty sure my knowledge of biology says this isn't going to work."  Whereas a child would figure the adult knew something they didn't and accept it.. perhaps that's the difference... hmm... I'll get the next segment of the story up tonight.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 14:04, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

Good point!  I hadn't thought about it like that yet.  As usual, a significant amount of our problems come from pride. [[User:Frew|Frew]] 14:29, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
