This is goats account of the first christmas:

From luke we know that the birth of John was announced to Zacharias before anything happened involving Jesus.  It is interesting to note the differences in the way that Mary and Zacharias took the news about children, we will get more into this later, but now the clock starts.  Elizabeth conceives and stays at home for 5 months.

Next in the 6th month Gabriel comes to Mary to announce that she is to bear the child of God even though she is a virgin.  She's probably around 16 and is engaged to a guy named Joseph who's probably a little older maybe mid-20s.  The first thing worth noting is the difference in the way that Mary responds to the angel, she first asks how this is even possible (she's not stupid) and then she vehemently proclaims that this is all totally awesome and she is proud to be Gods maidservant.  Compare this with Zacharias who responds by asking for a sign, perhaps just a little doubtful that this is possible (Abraham?).  It has been suggested that the mary responded appropriately by being excited and faithful, whereas Zacharias responded with doubt.  But I'd like to suggest that maybe we give mary a bit too much credit for her response.  (Note: the following is purely supposition, please don't hate me forever) I cannot account for the differences in cultures and times, but if you will inspect the standard teenage girl(or boy) you will notice they tend to be over-emotional and both headstrong (always right) and idealistic (my generation is going to do it right).  However, an older adult will most commonly be more circumspect, cautious, and skeptical about life.  So insert what we know generally about pychology into the story and look again at this idea that Mary was immediately gung ho for whatever, whereas Zacharias was a more cautious and skeptical.  I'm not going to declare that obvious Mary's response was to be expected of someone with her hormones and Zacharias's response was characteristic of a man with grey hair, but it is worth noting.  I think we tend to mythify people in the bible too much; they may have been extroidanary people, but they were still real people.  I think we can all remember times that we were excited to do something without fully understanding it's implications or consequences and it wasn't until later that we realized our error.  Again, I dont' want to minimize the faith required to say "yes Lord,"  but how much more faith is required when you fully understand the suffering and hardship to come.  Because I am not a theologian I'm not going to delve much deeper into the "right" course of action to be learned from this, but I think it's important to note how real people made decisions and their eventual consequences. 

Stay tuned for part II, Joseph find out!

(Hurray for RSS readers!)  Frew's 2 cents:  I'd just say that we '''are''' supposed to have faith like a child.  In that respect, yeah, it makes sense that a teenager would have more faith; and knowledge and wisdom regularly hinder faith.  I don't think that means we should have less knowledge, but we have to work to build our faith as we learn new things.  I don't want to sound like a Jesuit saying that I will deny science that I see if my faith differs from that.  I do think though that as our knowledge increases we need to get closer to God by spending more time with him.  Thoughts?  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 04:49, 22 October 2008 (UTC)


I totally agree that we '''are''' supposed to have faith like a child ( I mean it's word for word there) but what does that entail, does that entail faith from ignorance like a child has or something else, I think this is a pretty relevant issue with the intelligent design controversy.  Should we believe and follow Christ because we don't know any better, or should we rather put aside what we know to follow Him.  I think you could probably trace the roots to pride, the '''I know''' issue that infers my knowledge of life is superior to what God tells me whereas humility says maybe I'm wrong.  For instance, Zachariah says "how shall I know this" or really, "seriously, i'm pretty sure my knowledge of biology says this isn't going to work."  Whereas a child would figure the adult knew something they didn't and accept it.. perhaps that's the difference... hmm... I'll get the next segment of the story up tonight.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 14:04, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

Good point!  I hadn't thought about it like that yet.  As usual, a significant amount of our problems come from pride. [[User:Frew|Frew]] 14:29, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

In my many studies of Luke (hey, I'm on ch 17 now!), I've also seen the differences in the responses of Zacharias and Mary.  I think it kinda hits me everytime that I come across it.  I think it is interesting that '''both''' Zacharias and Mary have biological questions (Lk1:18 = age, Lk1:34 = virginity).  I think it is also interesting that God is glorified by both.  The only explicit difference that I have been able to come up with is that Zacharias "did not believe" (1:20, interesting how belief does not alter fulfilment), while Mary presents herself as "the bondslave of the Lord" (1:38, we also see this in v48).  So, both were presented with a biological "impossibility," both questioned it, but their responses were different.  That is all that we really get from scripture.  I think that the story is obviously setting up a contrast between the characters.  I don't know that the reasons why they acted differently, but I think that we need to be careful about how much weight that we give to things that are not explicitly mentioned, because if it was uber important, it would have been written down.  That's just a thought.  Anyways, I think you guys are onto something with the pride thing.  The background is that Zacharias is a priest, offering incense when the angel shows up.  THis was pretty much the biggest day of his life (the rotations only really allow this once) as a priest, so he was probably thinking that he was hot stuff, the some angel dude tells him that he's going to have a kid.  He'd probably had the reality of bareness well grounded in his head by this point (probably longer than Mary had been alive), then Gabriel rocked his world.  Interesting note, apparently Zacharias and Elizabeth had been praying for a child (v13).  Maybe Zacharias had lost faith in God and needed to have his mouth shut to bring him around?

Agreed Sparkums, I just think it was an interesting study in pychology, maybe someone else could run down the ways different people react to God based on age (first time only) I mean think about david, and moses, I'm sure there is more... anyways 

Part II Mary and Joseph have a talk:
So again, as this is "Christmas according to goat, I will skip things that I think are either uninteresting... or beat to death by christmas musical productions all over the world.  So Mary knows that she is going to have a kid, and he will be the Lord, next she decides,"I should go visit my aunt who lives out of town." Now here's a question, putting aside all of the spiritual reasons for visiting your Aunt, which are both many and relelvent (she's a Godly woman and Mary wants to share, she is wise and can give good counsel, and on and one) why does she go to visit Elizabeth "with haste."  So we all know from biology that girls experience their period about once a month, and the Jews had some very strict rules regarding this, about separation from people, purification offerings and such.  So if you are an unmarried, teenage girl who is currently not going to be having her period (remember this is going to involve about a week long separation from people and sacrifices and all kinds of good stuff) wouldn't it be conveinent to be away for a few months?  Basically it would allow her to put off telling Joseph (they were probably already engaged) it would allow her to not tell her parents immediately, and she could kind ease into this whole thing.  Now we know that Joseph eventually finds out, and agani the way it is worded, it sounds a little like she doens't tell him (Mary was "found" with Child) and thus the angel tells him to buck up and do his job.  Apparently, Jewish engagements usually lasted about a year and climaxed with a huge wedding and the wedding was consumated and off they go to start their new life.  According to some records the husband had to "prove" consumation before the wedding was official, imagine Joseph trying to figure out how he was going to have this wedding with a pregnant wife and not be able to consumate the marriage until at least 6 months later. In fact we don't know when they had the actual marriage, but I would bet that all the people in the village would know that the baby came at the latest only 6 months after the marriage... Hmm.... I think we don't often give Joseph enough credit, the poor guy got the raw end of the deal, awful wedding night, dealt with a "bastard child" monkier his whole life and probably died before Christ even started His ministry (life expectancy 50-55 years, probably less because hard labor career, and probably early to mid 20s when married).  Anywyas, the wedding happens because next time we're going to bethlehem! --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 01:16, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

Good call Goat.  I guess Joseph is a pretty darn good example of a manly man.[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 15:36, 25 October 2008 (UTC)
