So, I was studying Luke the other day and came to the parable in Luke 14:15-24.  So, I think that the main thing that Jesus is trying to get across here is that those who were initially invited to the kingdom of heaven (it made sense for them to be there) would reject the invitation and the invitation would then be extended to others, those who do not seem likely candidates of the meal/heaven.  The immediate context deals with the rejection of the pharisees that he's eating with, but I think there's some other things here.  The excuses that the the original attendees make are super lame.  They have been invited(apparently RSVPed a little earlier since they are being summoned to the banquet), accepted, but at the last minute decided not to go. Obviously the parable has eternal significance, but I think that it can also be applied to the way we approach God every day and with the "big decisions" of life.  I think this "meal" that Jesus was talking about is symbolic of the Kingdom of God.  Just as entering the Kingdom of God has an "already but not yet" significance, I think the implications of the parable have some "already" significance.  Besides the eternal focus, I think we have the choice each day to join God in his Kingdom (narrow vs. wide path?), but I also think that put forward lame excuses and miss out on the Kingdom.  Also, the guests that the dude throwing the banquet invited were excluded out of their own will, not by the guy who invited them.  Maybe they didn't understand the importance/significance of the banquet?  I don't think we really get it either.
