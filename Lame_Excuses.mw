So, I was studying Luke the other day and came to the parable in Luke 14:15-24.  So, I think that the main thing that Jesus is trying to get across here is that those who were initially invited to the kingdom of heaven (it made sense for them to be there) would reject the invitation and the invitation would then be extended to others, those who do not seem likely candidates of the meal/heaven.  The immediate context deals with the rejection of the pharisees that he's eating with, but I think there's some other things here.  The excuses that the the original attendees make are super lame.  They have been invited(apparently RSVPed a little earlier since they are being summoned to the banquet), accepted, but at the last minute decided not to go. Obviously the parable has eternal significance, but I think that it can also be applied to the way we approach God every day and with the "big decisions" of life.  I think this "meal" that Jesus was talking about is symbolic of the Kingdom of God.  Just as entering the Kingdom of God has an "already but not yet" significance, I think the implications of the parable have some "already" significance.  Besides the eternal focus, I think we have the choice each day to join God in his Kingdom (narrow vs. wide path?), but I also think that put forward lame excuses and miss out on the Kingdom.  Also, the guests that the dude throwing the banquet invited were excluded out of their own will, not by the guy who invited them.  Maybe they didn't understand the importance/significance of the banquet?  I don't think we really get it either.

Sparky man, you gotta start using paragraphs to separate thoughts, I think I've got a couple here to talk about...  So becci and I read this and talked about it the other day.  And the interesting part is two different versions of this parable are running around the gospels.  The first is the one you're mentioning, the other is in matthew ( I think) and the difference is in yours it's just some guy, and in the other it's the king.  Same thing happens, except at the end, the King is wandering through his banquet hall and throws a guy out for being dressed inappropriatly.
So we can agree this has eternal significance, and it's pretty easy to make those connections.  But I think you are dead on with the idea of daily attendance at Gods wedding feast, and moreso the portion about being dressed correctly.  We make those choices every day on whether to come to the wedding feast or to duck out with a "but i am le tired" excuse.  On a similar topic, I was thinking that a more eternal minded perspective would help with motivation for lots and lots of things... --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 11:40, 8 October 2008 (UTC)
