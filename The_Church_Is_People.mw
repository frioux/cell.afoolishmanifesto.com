This is just something that I've been thinking about as I've been reading Pagan Christianity.  We all know that the building isn't the church, but sometimes it's obvious that we don't actually believe that.  One major thing is that in our Christian walk, going to church is extracurricular.  I wouldn't say that it's bad, but certainly not required, as it is not the actual church.  That means that we should be learning and teaching almost entirely outside of church.  Another thing that this means is that if you think that the church should serve the poor, you need to go do it.  You can't just wait for someone to start up a soup kitchen thing.  You can of course use the church that you go to as a way to find people and tell them about stuff and invite them over and all that jazz.  I don't know, what do you guys think?

I guess i'm a little uncertain about "church is extracurricular,"  so on the floor we had a built in community, thus built in church, but outside of that atmosphere one has to establish that same sort of community in order to maintain the body.  Now this can be done via small groups or even friends, but "going to church" is going to be with that community.  "Blue like Jazz" discussed this idea as well that feeding the poor means, going out and feeding the poor, but I think something I've been struggling with is how does this affect me.  How do I reconcile Gods purpose for me to get a Phd in engineering and spending my time serving people.  Do I support those groups with money?  Do I work on projects that are humanitarian in nature?  How does this work practically once we have real jobs and families and stuff... --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 19:57, 8 September 2008 (UTC)


Interesting stuff.  I have actually been thinking about this stuff over the past couple of days.  I have decided to leave my church that I have been attending in Tulsa for the past several years.  So, I have really been thinking about church things lately.  One of the things that I have been thinking about is the importance of the "small group" aspect of church.  I think, especially from experience, that we cannot experience large, "corporate" worship well when there is not small group foundation.  I think that congregational worship on Sundays is very important, but it has to be in context within a community of believers that are involved with each others' lives in a much deeper way than just Sunday mornings.  I think that a person can "survive" spiritually with just the small group aspect, but I think there's more.  Also, I think that the most radical thing that God showed me this summer (this hit me constantly when I taught James) was the way that we treat the poor/ugly/annoying etc.  I think that, in short, we need to help everone that comes across our paths that we can help.  Here's some examples.  Heather and I were out on a date, and were walking downtown when we passed a homeless dude.  Initially I was going to do nothing about it, but between Heather and the Holy Spirit, I changed my mind.  We ended up taking him to a Subway nearby, gave him a sandwhich, and shared Christ with him.  Dad and I were able to help out some other people in the church through food, we opened the house up for several people that needed a place to stay, etc.  Anyways, I saw that the more I opened my eyes and was more receptive to helping people that the more opportunities I saw.--[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 19:58, 10 September 2008 (UTC)
