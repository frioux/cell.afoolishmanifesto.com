This is just something that I've been thinking about as I've been reading Pagan Christianity.  We all know that the building isn't the church, but sometimes it's obvious that we don't actually believe that.  One major thing is that in our Christian walk, going to church is extracurricular.  I wouldn't say that it's bad, but certainly not required, as it is not the actual church.  That means that we should be learning and teaching almost entirely outside of church.  Another thing that this means is that if you think that the church should serve the poor, you need to go do it.  You can't just wait for someone to start up a soup kitchen thing.  You can of course use the church that you go to as a way to find people and tell them about stuff and invite them over and all that jazz.  I don't know, what do you guys think?
