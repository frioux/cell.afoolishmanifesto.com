This is just something that I've been thinking about as I've been reading Pagan Christianity.  We all know that the building isn't the church, but sometimes it's obvious that we don't actually believe that.  One major thing is that in our Christian walk, going to church is extracurricular.  I wouldn't say that it's bad, but certainly not required, as it is not the actual church.  That means that we should be learning and teaching almost entirely outside of church.  Another thing that this means is that if you think that the church should serve the poor, you need to go do it.  You can't just wait for someone to start up a soup kitchen thing.  You can of course use the church that you go to as a way to find people and tell them about stuff and invite them over and all that jazz.  I don't know, what do you guys think?

I guess i'm a little uncertain about "church is extracurricular,"  so on the floor we had a built in community, thus built in church, but outside of that atmosphere one has to establish that same sort of community in order to maintain the body.  Now this can be done via small groups or even friends, but "going to church" is going to be with that community.  "Blue like Jazz" discussed this idea as well that feeding the poor means, going out and feeding the poor, but I think something I've been struggling with is how does this affect me.  How do I reconcile Gods purpose for me to get a Phd in engineering and spending my time serving people.  Do I support those groups with money?  Do I work on projects that are humanitarian in nature?  How does this work practically once we have real jobs and families and stuff... --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 19:57, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
