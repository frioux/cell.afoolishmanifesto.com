Okay, I've been meaning to write this one for a while, but yeah.  It's also the first attempt to attach photos, so here goes.

So, Heather came down to visit me for the weekend, and we went to the Tut exhibit in Dallas (lame in my opinion).  Afterward, we walked around the art district and saw some cathedrals.  THey looked pretty sweet, and Heather likes stained glass, so we checked them out.  The first one that we went to was Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe. [[Image:Example.jpg]].  It was the coolest church building that I have ever seen.  So, we walked in and I kinda freaked out on the inside.  Here we were on a Saturday afternoon, and people were praying in the "sancuary."  THe place was decked out too.  I'm not going to go into much detail though.  Heather tried to take a couple of pictures and I just sat down and thought about it.  THe idea of coming to church and praying had never crossed my mind before.  I think most of us protestants are "closet prayers."  Sure that's Biblical, but there's alot of "worldly" things in my room that distract me and make me want to pray/study my Bible less.  Sure, the whole purgatory and praying to Mary thing seems a good deal wrong to me, but going into that building has really peaked my interest.  So much work has been put into that building.  The details are amazing, and just about everything has a Biblical story or lesson to share. [[Image:Example.jpg]].  

So, next we went to First United Methodist.  [[Image:Example.jpg]] Also a cool building, but not as cool.  The first thing we noticed was the lack of bells in the bell tower (versus the 29 in the catholic tower).  There was alot of stained glass, but it looked plain from the outside.  The Catholic church was pretty inviting, while the Methodist one was not (it even had a nuclear fallout sign on the outside).  We went in and checked out their sanctuary.  Pretty big, pretty cool, but VERY plain.  The organ pipes were amazing [[Image:Example.jpg]], but the windows were kinda yucky [[Image:Example.jpg]].  The places were like polar opposites.  The Catholic church had everything that you could imagine, and the Methodist church had an organ (there were doves on the windows, but that's an earthy creature so it's "ok").  They did have some artwork [[Image:Example.jpg]] and an empty "Meditation and Prayer Room" [[Image:Example.jpg]].

So, I have realized that my views on church are quite narrow.  So I have been thinking about all of this for the past couple of days.  For most of my life, I have seen different churches (especially denominations) and being more right or more wrong.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Whose really right anyway?  The point that I'm getting at here is this.  God has made different people different, and he speaks to them and draws them differently.  My great aunt (amazing woman) came to Christ in a very charismatic setting.  She said that it was what she needed.  I currently go to a church that is designed for people that would not ordinarily go to church (LifePoint).  I see God at work there, but not really speaking to me.  I tend to be more of a traditional/classical person.  I like hymns rich with meaning that actually go along with a BIBLE based expository sermon.  Maybe my place is somewhere else.  So, I've been spending time praying in Speer Chapel (it's been very good) and I think I'm going to go on a little pilgrimage around a bunch of churches around town.  I'll keep you posted.

Sorry for the length, I've been thinking about this for a while.
