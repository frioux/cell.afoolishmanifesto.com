Okay, I've been meaning to write this one for a while, but yeah.  It's also the first attempt to attach photos, so here goes.  I put the pictures at the end for now.  I might add some more.


So, Heather came down to visit me for the weekend, and we went to the Tut exhibit in Dallas (lame in my opinion).  Afterward, we walked around the art district and saw some cathedrals.  They looked pretty sweet, and Heather likes stained glass, so we checked them out.  The first one that we went to was Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe. It was the coolest church building that I have ever seen.  So, we walked in and I kinda freaked out on the inside.  Here we were on a Saturday afternoon, and people were praying in the "sanctuary."  The place was decked out too.  I'm not going to go into much detail though.  Heather tried to take a couple of pictures and I just sat down and thought about it.  The idea of coming to church and praying had never crossed my mind before.  I think most of us protestants are "closet prayers."  Sure that's Biblical, but there's alot of "worldly" things in my room that distract me and make me want to pray/study my Bible less.  Sure, the whole purgatory and praying to Mary thing seems a good deal wrong to me, but going into that building has really peaked my interest.  So much work has been put into that building.  The details are amazing, and just about everything has a Biblical story or lesson to share.  There were lots of little windows with people/stories.  Here's another interesting thought.  The Catholics canonize "saints."  I think that is pretty cool.  I guess it's there way to remember awesome people and call others to live exemplary lives (they might take it a bit far, but The Cathedral Shrine to Sparky would be cool).  Also, they do alot of things to remember.  This reminds me of the Jewish high holidays and Ebineazer stones and such.  Don't protestants run from the idea of holiday stuff (halloween, the easter bunny, Christmas is to commercial, etc).

So, next we went to First United Methodist. Also a cool building, but not as cool.  The first thing we noticed was the lack of bells in the bell tower (versus the 29 in the catholic tower).  There was alot of stained glass, but it looked plain from the outside.  The Catholic church was pretty inviting, while the Methodist one was not (it even had a nuclear fallout sign on the outside).  We went in and checked out their sanctuary.  Pretty big, pretty cool, but VERY plain.  The organ pipes were amazing,but the windows were kinda yucky. The places were like polar opposites.  The Catholic church had everything that you could imagine, and the Methodist church had an organ (there were doves on the windows, but that's an earthy creature so it's "ok"). They did have some artwork and an empty "Meditation and Prayer Room."

So, I have realized that my views on church are quite narrow.  So I have been thinking about all of this for the past couple of days.  For most of my life, I have seen different churches (especially denominations) and being more right or more wrong.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Whose really right anyway?  The point that I'm getting at here is this.  God has made different people different, and he speaks to them and draws them differently.  My great aunt (amazing woman) came to Christ in a very charismatic setting.  She said that it was what she needed.  I currently go to a church that is designed for people that would not ordinarily go to church (LifePoint).  I see God at work there, but not really speaking to me.  I tend to be more of a traditional/classical person.  I like hymns rich with meaning that actually go along with a BIBLE based expository sermon.  Maybe my place is somewhere else.  So, I've been spending time praying in Speer Chapel (it's been very good) and I think I'm going to go on a little pilgrimage around a bunch of churches around town.  I'll keep you posted.

Sorry for the length, I've been thinking about this for a while.

I totally hear you Sparkster.  I recently had some similar thoughts in my Sunday School.  We are going through an Apologetics (The Reason for God) book and there is a part where he is talking about how with Christianity we actually have more freedom because we have the true constraints versus extra constraints and not using ones we need.  Anyway, that's a topic for another page, but what was interesting was how Christianity can thrive in all kinds of cultures very well, and because of that each culture can bring other strengths (and weaknesses) to the Table.  For example I think that one of the strengths that our culture has historically brought to the table has been a strong foundation in logic which of course leads to science and all that.  On the other hand, some cultures care a lot more about family, which has other benefits.


What I am getting at is that I agree with Sparky that we need to be open to other forms of Christianity (the basic tenets are pretty simple; belief that Jesus is the one and only savior) which may seem weird to us but still be good about some things.  And yeah, maybe they do things we think is wrong and crazy, like praying to saints, but thank God that we are forgiven for sinning, because I am certainly not perfect!

So, I've been trying to go to Speer Chapel everyday for my prayer time.  It has been really sweet.  I think it is good to go out to seek God.  One of the things that I have found to be really cool is the trip to Speer.  For me, it is a physical way for me to demonstrate my intentions before God.  I am going to a specific location for the purpose of seeking God, and whatever that entails for that day.  It's been really cool, because it also gives me some time to prepare myself.  Last night the thought crossed my mind about the Old Testament temple processions.  i wonder what it was like to have all of those people approaching the temple mount, singing to God as the prepared themselves to meet with him?  (I might have to memorize one of the songs of ascents).  Also, I used to be all about church buildings that were the cheepest construction possible to save money.  Hmmm...  I don't like that anymore.  I am fully aware that God reside in me, not some building, but I also think that the place that we gather for the explicit purpose of worshipping God should be pretty awesome.  Now, that is also controlled by the financial descisions of the church.  I came from a church that buried themselves in debt from a building to the point that they have cripled themselves financially for years (maybe forever?).  I'm looking forward to Sunday.  That will be my first week to visit around. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:18, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

There is a great deal of culture tied up in the way we present churches.  For instance in most of Europe church is a place you go to to seek God, go to pray, to sing, to confess, to be blessed, and so they are open all the time.  ANd when they built many of the cathedrals and bascilicas they did so to build  aplace that in of itself glorified God.  This meant they spared no effort to make it perfect.  For instance they totally revolutionized architecture to build a sanctuary big enough to fit everyone in.  There is some cathedrals that are thousands of years old and still are amazing.  I got the chance to wander through Notre Dame, San Marcos, and a few other just amazing churches.  Everything in them is symbolic, everything in them draws your attention to God, they aboslutely felt the place was important.  Kinda like you want to dress up before a date, they want to give their best to God and they did so by their buildings.  Unfortunealy because eventually the church power structure rivaled the civil structure, the catholic church became so corrupt that cathedrals were built to compete with neighbors and such, and it kinda cheapened the fact that some families worked for generations to finish these buildings both in the context of giving alms, but also in working because of the tremendous time it took to build them.  Absolutely amazing.  I wish we could get a hold of that idea just a little because I think it has merit, wouldn't it be neat to create a new architectual wonder for the church.... Finally, a little tidbit: the difference between a bascilica and a cathedral is whether or not it has holy remnents in it.  Kinda like upgrading your power crystal, remnents get you bascilica status.  I think the pope might be able to do something special about it too but mostly it's bits of old dead guys..pax  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 01:24, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

You guys should check out an Episcopal church some time.  I went to Good Shepherd (http://www.goodshepherdcedarhill.org/) when I lived in the Dallas area, and now I go to St. Timothy's in Catonsville, MD (http://www.sttimscatonsville.org/).  They've got a lot of the "high church" stuff that Catholics do, and the liturgy is pretty much amazing, but they're protestant in their beliefs, so that part is more of what we're used to.  You've probably heard of all the problems the denomination is having right now.  A lot of the churches really are a bit wacky in their teachings, so the trick is to find a good one.  If you're in Dallas, I can definitely recommend Good Shepherd (tell Fr. Todd I said Hi!), but otherwise, check out this site: http://www.united-anglicans.org/.  They've got a good listing of Episcopal churches that are still sane.

I used to have the impression that liturgical churches were for people who didn't really care about their beliefs and just wanted to repeat the same things over and over again to feel good about themselves.  But that's not the case at all.  The liturgy is incredibly rich--the Book of Common Prayer has a ton of really amazing stuff in it.  It's not so much repeating things as it is taking part in a tradition that has been established and refined for literally hundreds of years.  The prayers that we pray from the Book of Common Prayer aren't something that was just made up on the spur of the moment, but something that gifted men of God wrote with care.  Not that we worship the liturgy. :-)  The service is really quite flexible, and the readings change on a multi-year cycle, so stuff doesn't get old.  And not everything is planned out.  For example, there are times specifically set aside for prayers of intercession or thanksgiving from the congregation.  I also appreciate the reverence for worship that a liturgical service has.

Oh, and if you do decide to visit one (you should!), don't worry about accidentally offending people if you don't know what's going on with the liturgy or don't know when to kneel or something.  People won't mind at all, and they'd probably love to talk with you after the service.  Bonus: most Episcopal churches serve refreshments after every service, which is a great time to meet people, too.

Anyway, that's more than I intended to write.  Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the Episcopal church--it is different in many ways.  I'm not an expert, but I know several people who are. :-)  --[[User:Fjord|Fjord]] 02:04, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

Thanks Fjord!  I've actually been to the Episcopalian church in Longview once.  It was pretty sweet, and I intend to visit it again.  It's good to hear the viewpoint from someone on the "other side" of things.  I've grown up in Christian circles that view the liturgy as super lame.  Thanks also for the website links!

So, here's some updates.  I'll try to keep this stuff sorta short and keep it focussed on my original curiosity with what I know now as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_church "High Church"] so it doesn't become a blog.  Saturday I went church shopping in an unorthodox manner--I looked around downtown for cool church buildings (I was looking for places that had meaning in their architecture).  I brought my camera and spent over 2 hours checking out/taking pictures of 6 churches.  I was originally going to try to go to as many services as I could in one Sunday, but later decided that it would be best to go to everything of each church instead of skipping around.

[[Image:Trinity front.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Trinity Episcopalian Front]][[Image:Trinity back.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Trinity Episcopalian Back]]So, Trinity Episcopalian was first.  I had been once several years ago, but I don't think I was ready to be open enough to care for it.  I went to the 8am service, 9am coffee break, 9:15am "Christian Education" (Sunday School), and the 10:30am service.  I couldn't quit writing "Awesome!" and "Gnarly!" in my journal.  It was a completely different service than I am used to, but I really liked it.  Several of the aspects of the architecture/high church really called me to worship, and I don't even understand the significance of what everything means (yet).

I picked up some literature from Trinity, am researching this stuff on the internet, "borrowed" a copy of ''The Book of Common Prayer'' from Speer, and I'm going to start going to Dr. Watson's LAMP (LeTourneau at Morning Prayer) in Speer.  I went to LAMP Monday and led the responsive reading.

Also, some very good points about church architecture, namely cathedrals, were brought up in my Western Civ class.  So, supposedly the rise of universities came from cathedrals (this reminds me of Goat's ideas of financial uses [http://cell.afoolishmanifesto.com/wiki/Corporate_Finances Corporate Finances].  So, these church architect dudes used their skills to present their worldview.  For instance, the huge towers (and in the case of Trinity, the bell tower, height of the sanctuary, and the rose window) were meant to draw your eyes to heaven and think about spiritual things.  Alot of these churches were designed in the shape of a cross and had a specific cardinal orientation in conjunction with the themes of the stained glass windows to all come together to tell a story.  Alot of people were illiterate, and so the architecture/art of the church was designed to speak to them and remind them of the Bible stories and theological concepts.  Sure, the average Joe could not figure everything out by himself, but once explained, they could be used as reminders.  They original guys that did this stuff viewed it as not just building something, but building something that would testify to the glory of God.  Another consequence of the awesomeness of the cathedrals has been that many secular people have studied them because of the architectural feats, and the gospel is unavoidable.

So, here's another part of my church building question redefined--why do these old buildings testify to the glory of God and alot of our new churches suck?  Why is the cool/new architecture going to financial buildings and not churches (back to Goat's idea that there's not been too much in the way of new architectural revolutions from the church)?  Now, I do not think that a church should build a Gothic Cathedral.  I think the church needs to be progressive in the way that it presents the gospel, in a way that its culture can understand.  How can we build/do church in a way that everything is significant and brings glory to God and the gospel to the masses in 2008?![[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:40, 1 November 2008 (UTC)

I guess a better question sparky is what culture would we aim to shoot for.  I mean in the period when cathedrals and such were built (the old ones) the culture was reasonably consistant (at least church culture) because of the roman catholic church.  Now today, because the cultures are so much more diverse, if we make something that is impacting to one group it may totally miss another, or worse yet alienate another.  A great example is christian hardcore/punk music, great for a certain group of people, but totally repulsive to another.  Is it possible for us to create a "one size fits all" church anymore?  To bing it to a more personal level, when I design my house someday I want to create a fusion of design that includes extremely old elements (big timber framing, stone work) timeless elements (copper/slate roofing, hardwood and granite) and modern elements (stainless, glass, hung architecture, and energy efficiency) but to take this to another level of complexity with a public/multiuse building like a church that uses incredible architecture as well as impressive materials is both extremely difficult and expensive.  Do you think most churches would be willing to do that sort of thing?  In my opinion you could write the cost of as marketing (big coporations do this all the time).  I mean with the extra cost of building a cool building over a metal pole barn you  could send missionaries overseas and feed homeless, but you could also pay for an incredible timeless marketing piece for the gospel here at home... hmmm.. what  do you think.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 18:16, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
