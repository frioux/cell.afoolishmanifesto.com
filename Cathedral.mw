Okay, I've been meaning to write this one for a while, but yeah.  It's also the first attempt to attach photos, so here goes.  I put the pictures at the end for now.  I might add some more.


So, Heather came down to visit me for the weekend, and we went to the Tut exhibit in Dallas (lame in my opinion).  Afterward, we walked around the art district and saw some cathedrals.  They looked pretty sweet, and Heather likes stained glass, so we checked them out.  The first one that we went to was Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe. It was the coolest church building that I have ever seen.  So, we walked in and I kinda freaked out on the inside.  Here we were on a Saturday afternoon, and people were praying in the "sanctuary."  The place was decked out too.  I'm not going to go into much detail though.  Heather tried to take a couple of pictures and I just sat down and thought about it.  The idea of coming to church and praying had never crossed my mind before.  I think most of us protestants are "closet prayers."  Sure that's Biblical, but there's alot of "worldly" things in my room that distract me and make me want to pray/study my Bible less.  Sure, the whole purgatory and praying to Mary thing seems a good deal wrong to me, but going into that building has really peaked my interest.  So much work has been put into that building.  The details are amazing, and just about everything has a Biblical story or lesson to share.  There were lots of little windows with people/stories.  Here's another interesting thought.  The Catholics canonize "saints."  I think that is pretty cool.  I guess it's there way to remember awesome people and call others to live exemplary lives (they might take it a bit far, but The Cathedral Shrine to Sparky would be cool).  Also, they do alot of things to remember.  This reminds me of the Jewish high holidays and Ebineazer stones and such.  Don't protestants run from the idea of holiday stuff (halloween, the easter bunny, Christmas is to commercial, etc). 

[[Image:Example1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Jesus rose window]] [[Image:Dude.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Dudes on windows]]


So, next we went to First United Methodist. Also a cool building, but not as cool.  The first thing we noticed was the lack of bells in the bell tower (versus the 29 in the catholic tower).  There was alot of stained glass, but it looked plain from the outside.  The Catholic church was pretty inviting, while the Methodist one was not (it even had a nuclear fallout sign on the outside).  We went in and checked out their sanctuary.  Pretty big, pretty cool, but VERY plain.  The organ pipes were amazing,but the windows were kinda yucky. The places were like polar opposites.  The Catholic church had everything that you could imagine, and the Methodist church had an organ (there were doves on the windows, but that's an earthy creature so it's "ok"). They did have some artwork and an empty "Meditation and Prayer Room."

[[Image:Example4.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Methodist organ pipes]][[Image:Catholic organ.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Catholic organ]]
 

So, I have realized that my views on church are quite narrow.  So I have been thinking about all of this for the past couple of days.  For most of my life, I have seen different churches (especially denominations) and being more right or more wrong.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Whose really right anyway?  The point that I'm getting at here is this.  God has made different people different, and he speaks to them and draws them differently.  My great aunt (amazing woman) came to Christ in a very charismatic setting.  She said that it was what she needed.  I currently go to a church that is designed for people that would not ordinarily go to church (LifePoint).  I see God at work there, but not really speaking to me.  I tend to be more of a traditional/classical person.  I like hymns rich with meaning that actually go along with a BIBLE based expository sermon.  Maybe my place is somewhere else.  So, I've been spending time praying in Speer Chapel (it's been very good) and I think I'm going to go on a little pilgrimage around a bunch of churches around town.  I'll keep you posted.

Sorry for the length, I've been thinking about this for a while.
[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 22:12, 16 October 2008 (UTC)



I totally hear you Sparkster.  I recently had some similar thoughts in my Sunday School.  We are going through an Apologetics (The Reason for God) book and there is a part where he is talking about how with Christianity we actually have more freedom because we have the true constraints versus extra constraints and not using ones we need.  Anyway, that's a topic for another page, but what was interesting was how Christianity can thrive in all kinds of cultures very well, and because of that each culture can bring other strengths (and weaknesses) to the Table.  For example I think that one of the strengths that our culture has historically brought to the table has been a strong foundation in logic which of course leads to science and all that.  On the other hand, some cultures care a lot more about family, which has other benefits.


What I am getting at is that I agree with Sparky that we need to be open to other forms of Christianity (the basic tenets are pretty simple; belief that Jesus is the one and only savior) which may seem weird to us but still be good about some things.  And yeah, maybe they do things we think is wrong and crazy, like praying to saints, but thank God that we are forgiven for sinning, because I am certainly not perfect!

[[Image:Jesus.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Methodist mosaic]][[Image:Meditation.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Methodist meditation alter thingy]]


So, I've been trying to go to Speer Chapel everyday for my prayer time.  It has been really sweet.  I think it is good to go out to seek God.  One of the things that I have found to be really cool is the trip to Speer.  For me, it is a physical way for me to demonstrate my intentions before God.  I am going to a specific location for the purpose of seeking God, and whatever that entails for that day.  It's been really cool, because it also gives me some time to prepare myself.  Last night the thought crossed my mind about the Old Testament temple processions.  i wonder what it was like to have all of those people approaching the temple mount, singing to God as the prepared themselves to meet with him?  (I might have to memorize one of the songs of ascents).  Also, I used to be all about church buildings that were the cheepest construction possible to save money.  Hmmm...  I don't like that anymore.  I am fully aware that God reside in me, not some building, but I also think that the place that we gather for the explicit purpose of worshipping God should be pretty awesome.  Now, that is also controlled by the financial descisions of the church.  I came from a church that buried themselves in debt from a building to the point that they have cripled themselves financially for years (maybe forever?).  I'm looking forward to Sunday.  That will be my first week to visit around. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:18, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

There is a great deal of culture tied up in the way we present churches.  For instance in most of Europe church is a place you go to to seek God, go to pray, to sing, to confess, to be blessed, and so they are open all the time.  ANd when they built many of the cathedrals and bascilicas they did so to build  aplace that in of itself glorified God.  This meant they spared no effort to make it perfect.  For instance they totally revolutionized architecture to build a sanctuary big enough to fit everyone in.  There is some cathedrals that are thousands of years old and still are amazing.  I got the chance to wander through Notre Dame, San Marcos, and a few other just amazing churches.  Everything in them is symbolic, everything in them draws your attention to God, they aboslutely felt the place was important.  Kinda like you want to dress up before a date, they want to give their best to God and they did so by their buildings.  Unfortunealy because eventually the church power structure rivaled the civil structure, the catholic church became so corrupt that cathedrals were built to compete with neighbors and such, and it kinda cheapened the fact that some families worked for generations to finish these buildings both in the context of giving alms, but also in working because of the tremendous time it took to build them.  Absolutely amazing.  I wish we could get a hold of that idea just a little because I think it has merit, wouldn't it be neat to create a new architectual wonder for the church.... Finally, a little tidbit: the difference between a bascilica and a cathedral is whether or not it has holy remnents in it.  Kinda like upgrading your power crystal, remnents get you bascilica status.  I think the pope might be able to do something special about it too but mostly it's bits of old dead guys..pax  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 01:24, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

You guys should check out an Episcopal church some time.  I went to Good Shepherd (http://www.goodshepherdcedarhill.org/) when I lived in the Dallas area, and now I go to St. Timothy's in Catonsville, MD (http://www.sttimscatonsville.org/).  They've got a lot of the "high church" stuff that Catholics do, and the liturgy is pretty much amazing, but they're protestant in their beliefs, so that part is more of what we're used to.  You've probably heard of all the problems the denomination is having right now.  A lot of the churches really are a bit wacky in their teachings, so the trick is to find a good one.  If you're in Dallas, I can definitely recommend Good Shepherd (tell Fr. Todd I said Hi!), but otherwise, check out this site: http://www.united-anglicans.org/.  They've got a good listing of Episcopal churches that are still sane.

I used to have the impression that liturgical churches were for people who didn't really care about their beliefs and just wanted to repeat the same things over and over again to feel good about themselves.  But that's not the case at all.  The liturgy is incredibly rich--the Book of Common Prayer has a ton of really amazing stuff in it.  It's not so much repeating things as it is taking part in a tradition that has been established and refined for literally hundreds of years.  The prayers that we pray from the Book of Common Prayer aren't something that was just made up on the spur of the moment, but something that gifted men of God wrote with care.  Not that we worship the liturgy. :-)  The service is really quite flexible, and the readings change on a multi-year cycle, so stuff doesn't get old.  And not everything is planned out.  For example, there are times specifically set aside for prayers of intercession or thanksgiving from the congregation.  I also appreciate the reverence for worship that a liturgical service has.

Oh, and if you do decide to visit one (you should!), don't worry about accidentally offending people if you don't know what's going on with the liturgy or don't know when to kneel or something.  People won't mind at all, and they'd probably love to talk with you after the service.  Bonus: most Episcopal churches serve refreshments after every service, which is a great time to meet people, too.

Anyway, that's more than I intended to write.  Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the Episcopal church--it is different in many ways.  I'm not an expert, but I know several people who are. :-)  --[[User:Fjord|Fjord]] 02:04, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

Thanks Fjord!  I've actually been to the Episcopalian church in Longview once.  It was pretty sweet, and I intend to visit it again.  It's good to hear the viewpoint from someone on the "other side" of things.  I've grown up in Christian circles that view the liturgy as super lame.  Thanks also for the website links!  [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 15:48, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

So, here's some updates.  I'll try to keep this stuff sorta short and keep it focussed on my original curiosity with what I know now as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_church "High Church"] so it doesn't become a blog.  Saturday I went church shopping in an unorthodox manner--I looked around downtown for cool church buildings (I was looking for places that had meaning in their architecture).  I brought my camera and spent over 2 hours checking out/taking pictures of 6 churches.  I was originally going to try to go to as many services as I could in one Sunday, but later decided that it would be best to go to everything of each church instead of skipping around.

[[Image:Trinity front.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Trinity Episcopalian Front]][[Image:Trinity back.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Trinity Episcopalian Back]]So, Trinity Episcopalian was first.  I had been once several years ago, but I don't think I was ready to be open enough to care for it.  I went to the 8am service, 9am coffee break, 9:15am "Christian Education" (Sunday School), and the 10:30am service.  I couldn't quit writing "Awesome!" and "Gnarly!" in my journal.  It was a completely different service than I am used to, but I really liked it.  Several of the aspects of the architecture/high church really called me to worship, and I don't even understand the significance of what everything means (yet).

I picked up some literature from Trinity, am researching this stuff on the internet, "borrowed" a copy of ''The Book of Common Prayer'' from Speer, and I'm going to start going to Dr. Watson's LAMP (LeTourneau at Morning Prayer) in Speer.  I went to LAMP Monday and led the responsive reading.

Also, some very good points about church architecture, namely cathedrals, were brought up in my Western Civ class.  So, supposedly the rise of universities came from cathedrals (this reminds me of Goat's ideas of financial uses [http://cell.afoolishmanifesto.com/wiki/Corporate_Finances Corporate Finances].  So, these church architect dudes used their skills to present their worldview.  For instance, the huge towers (and in the case of Trinity, the bell tower, height of the sanctuary, and the rose window) were meant to draw your eyes to heaven and think about spiritual things.  Alot of these churches were designed in the shape of a cross and had a specific cardinal orientation in conjunction with the themes of the stained glass windows to all come together to tell a story.  Alot of people were illiterate, and so the architecture/art of the church was designed to speak to them and remind them of the Bible stories and theological concepts.  Sure, the average Joe could not figure everything out by himself, but once explained, they could be used as reminders.  They original guys that did this stuff viewed it as not just building something, but building something that would testify to the glory of God.  Another consequence of the awesomeness of the cathedrals has been that many secular people have studied them because of the architectural feats, and the gospel is unavoidable.

So, here's another part of my church building question redefined--why do these old buildings testify to the glory of God and alot of our new churches suck?  Why is the cool/new architecture going to financial buildings and not churches (back to Goat's idea that there's not been too much in the way of new architectural revolutions from the church)?  Now, I do not think that a church should build a Gothic Cathedral.  I think the church needs to be progressive in the way that it presents the gospel, in a way that its culture can understand.  How can we build/do church in a way that everything is significant and brings glory to God and the gospel to the masses in 2008?![[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 21:40, 1 November 2008 (UTC)

I guess a better question sparky is what culture would we aim to shoot for.  I mean in the period when cathedrals and such were built (the old ones) the culture was reasonably consistant (at least church culture) because of the roman catholic church.  Now today, because the cultures are so much more diverse, if we make something that is impacting to one group it may totally miss another, or worse yet alienate another.  A great example is christian hardcore/punk music, great for a certain group of people, but totally repulsive to another.  Is it possible for us to create a "one size fits all" church anymore?  To bing it to a more personal level, when I design my house someday I want to create a fusion of design that includes extremely old elements (big timber framing, stone work) timeless elements (copper/slate roofing, hardwood and granite) and modern elements (stainless, glass, hung architecture, and energy efficiency) but to take this to another level of complexity with a public/multiuse building like a church that uses incredible architecture as well as impressive materials is both extremely difficult and expensive.  Do you think most churches would be willing to do that sort of thing?  In my opinion you could write the cost of as marketing (big coporations do this all the time).  I mean with the extra cost of building a cool building over a metal pole barn you  could send missionaries overseas and feed homeless, but you could also pay for an incredible timeless marketing piece for the gospel here at home... hmmm.. what  do you think.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 18:16, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

That's been my question Goat.  I do remember visting 1st Baptist Eulus Texas once.  It was laid out very well, and was very afoordable (the price per square foot was about half of the price of one of the other churches I was a member of).  It had a large empty tomb outside, and the pulpit was huge, emphasizing the word of God.  I don't remember too much, because this was several years ago.  I've thought about going back, but I don't know if I ever will.

SO, last Sunday I went to First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Longview.  Let's just say that I was not overly impressed.  The traditional service had quite a bit of neat symbolism, but I'm still not sure what to think of the sermon.  I think it is a shame to have so much meaning in everything except the sermon!  I personally think that we should really stick to the word, and what it says.  Save all the meaningless stories, and explain scripture!  Anyways, I had some interesting thoughts during the service.  First, I think church is a funny thing.  It is so different from everyting else that we do in life.  The early church pretty much just used things that were already cultural norms (more or less).  They did what they knew.  So now, churches seem to do things that, if you did not grow up with it, seem really funky.  These "funky" things have come from tradition.  Obviously we need to not follow the first church, but how much should culture play in our church?  I think tradition is awesome, but how much should we use?  Paul had a habit of becoming what he needed to become to reach everyone that he could (1 cor 9:19-23).  So, should church be different than culture for the sake of some awesome traditions, or should we morph somewhat to reach more (i.e. LifePoint)?  I think that we tend to do what we do, because that is what we have done.  I'm personally questioning the whole thing.  Who knows, maybe what I was doing is the best thing to do?  The most interesting person I talked to was a lady that was an ordained minister who I think had her M. Div or higher.  She was the mother-in-law of Dr. Seth Norton (an old Flooder!).  She had spent alot of time with the questions that I'm asking.  She grew up a Southern Baptist, but had recently spent more time in the charismatic circles.  She was good to talk to though.  She told me that the pastor of that church had brought together the big churches in the area (all denominations) to serve the community, and it has much success.  I guess that Longview is known for its care of the homeless to the point that many homeless people move to the area because of the reputations.  I think it is neat to see how the churches have come together in the name of Christ to support the needy and share the gospel.

P.S. protestants preach forever...
[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 20:09, 8 November 2008 (UTC)


I think it would probably be feasible to have a church that reached out to small groups without making a whole different church.  I mean, yeah, you'd end up with some compromises, but it could be worth it.  I don't know exactly how you could do it, but for example: I think that the stuff that LifePoint does could be done by a lot of churches.  People would just have to be willing to go to church on Saturday instead of Sunday.  I am just saying that I think there is a good balance somewhere and that you can "be all things to all people" without being one thing for a small group of people.  Does that make sense?  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 23:22, 8 November 2008 (UTC)


I've been apart of stuff like you're talking about Frew, and it was amazing!  My old church back home does the same thing.  They do not have Sunday night worship so that that time (or another time during the week) could be used for the groups to meet.  The groups are made so that there are a person or 2 in charge and not more than 8 members involved.  They were designed so that they could slowly grow, and multiply once they got to a certain size.  Pretty cool stuff in theory at least.  2 summers ago I was directly a part of an "Life Group."  The group was centered around eating a meal together, studying the Bible, sharing life, and praying.  It waS super sweet!  This last summer I started a Bible study for some of the guys from church (and outside of church).  It wasn't just a Bible study, it was also geared towards more of a small group setting.

[[Image:RUM.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Longview First United Methodist]]

So, I went to Longview First United Methodist this last Sunday, an I think that I finally saw a little more of what my church search has been about.  I showed up a little late for Sunday school (alarm and directional issues...), and I hate to be late.  No one was there.  That was kinda a minor irritation.  A few people slowly filtered in, and we started pretty late.  I tend to be a fairly punctual person, so I was already not in the best attitude (not bad, just not perfect).  They they turned on a movie.  This is a personal conviction, but it ticks me off when people show videos, especially on a routine basis, during Sunday School.  I think it is a cop-out and various other sorts of things for a different post.  The video was one of Rob Bell's Nooma videos, which made me a little more angry.  I don't really have anything against the guy, but I'm not a very artsy sort of guy, and his videos don't really do anything for me at all.  The topic of the movie was "Anger."  He was saying that alot of things anger us, but what do we do with that anger?  He used some examples of the anger of Jesus at the pharisees caused him to good things and heal people around him (I question some of his interpretation, but agree with his reasoning).  The point of the lesson was to question whether we use the energy that anger causes in us to do harm, or bring peace around us.  After the video, the teacher asked us what made us angry.  The first thing that came to mind was mediocrity in the church, especially Sunday school (I kept my mouth shut).  So, the question is, what do I do with this?  I have gone back to my first journal (in like 7th or 8th grade), and one of the first things that I had written about was my anger toward the mediocrity of Sunday School.  People have got on to me (I used to be more vocal about what irritated me) in the past for my feelings toward Sunday School and Church things in general.  But, if there's something that produces a legitimate anger in me, should my anger cease if the problem has not? So, my conclusion is this: I'm going to do something about it.  Got has given me a huge desire/joy over studying and teaching the Bible, and I think that the fact that I do not currently have an outlet, that I'm going crazy.  As soon as I find a church post graduation, I need to invest myself in some sort of teaching capacity.  I think this search for different churches has been a search for people that are not mediocre and a worship style that is infused with meaning, and the best way to get that is if I employ my gifts in the body.  What do you guys think?  Does this even make sense? [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 01:09, 18 November 2008 (UTC)



I think you have some really solid ideas there Sparky.  I would say that it might be good if you started something sooner than later though.  I mean, at the very least see if you can do a couple interesting lessons for floor devos next semester.  Just a suggestion.  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 20:16, 18 November 2008 (UTC)


Your graduating this december right?  It would make more sense to wait if that's the case, maybe do a devo before you leave (a la J hizzle/ and goat) I very much agree with your ideas about "mediocrity" in the church, I think you could probably even expand it to mediocrity in christians in general, that is one of the big reason I appreciated the way LU grads are told to be really awesome in all they do because we should be good at our jobs for colossians 3:23 if for no other reason.  

However, Something we've talked about this mornign in my mens study was the idea of reacting vs just acting.  Often the church just reacts (or people) to events.  For example, we see something we don't like and make a vow against it, thus bounding our identity and style in an "anti."  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it means your not standing or acting for something, you're just against somehting.  So rather than being against mediocrity in the sunday school, be for awesome teaching in sunday school.  I know because of my personaillity I am preaching more to myself than to any of you, but it is worth considering.  

Finally, I think you are totally on to something sparky about finding some outlet for your teaching passion.  The more I think about missional  work for the kind of christianity we always talk about the more I think it depends on indiviual participation vs institutional work.  Steve Prefontaine (a distance runner) said "to give less than your best is to sacrifice the gift."  He was talking about athletic performance, but I think it's also relevent to using our gifts and passions for Gods kingdom.  I compare it to the success of the LEGS project, the LEGS project only works by the blood, tears and sacrifices of the students working on it.  I know that, sparky knows that, anyone who has worked on the team knows that, but throguh that sacrifice comes great benefit.  Thoughts?  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:20, 19 November 2008 (UTC)

I think you are right on the money in trying not to define yourself with respect to the anti GOAT.  The main thing that I'd say to keep in mind is that you shouldn't do anything in terms of anything except for God.  How does that play out in everyday life?  That's a whole different post.  But remember, life isn't about teaching or even doing the right thing, it's about the relationship and therefore glorification of God.  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 17:12, 19 November 2008 (UTC)

I guess to clear things up a bit, my desire for teaching is more of a desire to fulfill the calling that God has placed in me versus the "anti" approach.  I love teaching, and I have been looking forward to graduating (I graduate in December!) for several years now so that I can do something like teach a sunday school class.  This kinda also goes along with our Youth Group discussion about being involved with the younger folk, and this has been my intentions for quite a while now.  I have been doing this over the summers at the church I went to back home, but I'm looking forward to more of a permanent basis rather than a little here and a little there.  As far as an "exit devo," I don't know.  We'll see.

P.S. I totally agree on the LEGS note about giving all.

[[Image:AM.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Asbury Methodist]]
So, I went to Church at Asbury Methodist in Tulsa over break.  It was pretty sweet after this whole pondering of church architecture and such.  They just built a new building like 2-3 years ago.  THe thing is a monster.  You can see the steeple from like 10+ miles in all directions.  I have always wanted to go, but I have never had an excuse.  It's a pretty gnarly building.  For one, it is like the most visible building, by far, in south Tulsa.  It is very well done, but not overdone.  Whenever you walk in the main entrance, there's a big motto thingy above the sanctuary door that says something to the extent of "Glorify God.........Evangelize the World."  I also heard some of the most solid Biblical teaching during the sermon that I have heard in a long time.  Also neat, everyone stood and read the scripture together.  This was like a breath of fresh air for me. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 05:59, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:Boston Avenue Methodist.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Boston Avenue Methodist]]
So, I was in Tulsa this last weekend and was looking for a church to go to.  I didn't find anything that I really wanted to visit, so I resorted to looking for a sweet building and decided to go to Boston Avenue Methodist.  I've wanted to check it out for a while, but I have never made it.  I got some informational pamphlets when I arrived to check out stuff, and I think that this building had more infused in it than any other I had been to.  Here's a quote from the first pastor that I found interesting
"All appointments have been designed with the hope of creating a place that is honest, harmonious, and spiritualized; that those who may not respond through their reason and those who may not react through their emotion, may at least through the visualization be moved to a higher conception of the Presence of Divine Power" - Dr. Adah M. Robinson.  I would agree (not looking very theologically deep into his statement) that it would be a good thing to convey things about God though architecture, but I now question the validity of trying to do so.  I paid attention to my thoughts as I was in church and looked at all of the symbolism.  The purpose is to glorify God, but my response to what i saw did not meet that purpose.  I was in awe of the coolness of the building, not the glory of God.  If the building does not have the desired response in me (even after researching what everything meant), how are the lost going to respond?  Also, it seems all these sweet church buildings have had lousy preachers.  I wonder what effects that the buildings have on congregations?  i've thought about checking out some other churches in Houston.  What do you guys think?  Do you think that the architecture is actually able to glorify God? [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 17:22, 22 April 2009 (UTC)


I'd say most churches, sweet or not, probably have lousy preachers.  But aside from that, I'd say that if we are not actively leading people to God, then it is a function of the Holy Spirit to call people.  Amazing architecture can be a tool of God surely.  But more importantly the glorification of God is our ultimate aim (whether it be through love or science or whatever) and shirking on that in the architectural department because it may or may not lead the lost to God doesn't make sense to me.  I think we should lead the lost to God.  I also think we should do all things as if we were doing them for God.  Those things are not a feedback loop.  We should do '''both''' of them.  Does that make sense? [[User:Frew|Frew]] 19:38, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

I totally agree with you Frew.  I think we need to glorify god in everything (all at the same time).  I'm just not sure the best way to do it architecturally without drawing attention to the buiding or to man.  Which do you guys think is better, to build a building designed to glorify God but ends up glorifying man, or build a simpler building that is less intricately designed (less aim to glorify God through the actual architecture, but not aimless) but is not a distraction?  I think I would almost prefer the latter. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 17:31, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

Sparky, my point is more that the way we build a building doesn't necessarily have the same effect on all people.  I think that amazing buildings are fine as long as our focus is on God, which in turn leads us to focus on other people.  (Note: I didn't say an expensive building.)  I think ultimately where I come from is that if someone won't be lead to God the building won't matter.  If they will be lead to God the building '''could''' matter, but I doubt that it will negatively matter if the building is nice.  Does that make sense?

I totally agree/understand. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 16:56, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

Soo... I've been absent for a while, finals and such, anyways, I think one of the things that I've learned about church through my experience at my current church is that a well functioning church must be diverse.  I mean we saw this on the floor and lauded it compared to certian other groups on campus.  You need people of differing viewpoints and differing skillsets otherwise you get into a rut.  I think in general this may one of the big problems in american churches, we have so many options that we end up finding one that suits us perfectly and we aren't challenged and we aren't annoyed and we aren't made to love people.  It's just not stimulating anymore.  When I hang out with business people, and artists and farmers, I am challenged by their differeing points of view and they are challenged by mine.  I realize this is kind of a round about way to get at it, but this makes me think that maybe the plethora of denominations, each having minutly different opinions on things is killing the church because there is no discussion, no challenging and no growth.  The times we are struggling and arguing and working through things are when we really grow.  And I think the church building is an outgowth issue of this idea, in the US (generally) people think the church should be plain and use it's money for useful things, not pretty buildings.  This is a fine viewpoint, but it needs to be counterpointed.  For instance if a church congregation really struggled over how to design their new church for a few years and argued and debated such, in the end if they were following Christ they would end up with something that really had meaning to them and symbolism they understood.  Some people would be anti decoration and they would put limits on the number of spires and flourishes the building had and some people would be artists and they would beatify the plain geometry.  Anyways... I realize I've been kind of rambling, but I think this building issue, may run a little deeper then just appearances..  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 15:41, 15 May 2009 (UTC)
