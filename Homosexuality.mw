Homosexuality.

To start off, I would like to send everyone to go and read an interesting article. Before clicking, let me preface by saying that the author is a self-confessed conservative evangelical, straight, married to a pastor, with two kids. Now, on to the article: [http://www.musingson.com/ccCase.html A Conservative Christian Case for Civil Same-Sex Marriage]. Please, read with an open mind, and respond here.

Interesting article. I haven't read it in full yet, and need to study it more. I do have a question, however, related to the author's assertion that gays have the right to marry each other. Where do our rights come from? Our founders thought that they come from God, and I think I would tend to agree. I don't really care what a chief justice of the supreme court has to say about what my rights are. Marriage is an institution created by God, and I think God's definition of marriage is fairly clear in the Bible. So, does God give me the right to marry another man? For that matter, does God give me the right to marry my sister, my two best girlfriends, or my dog? What are my rights related to marriage, how far do they go, and why?
