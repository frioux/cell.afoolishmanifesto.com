Homosexuality.

To start off, I would like to send everyone to go and read an interesting article. Before clicking, let me preface by saying that the author is a self-confessed conservative evangelical, straight, married to a pastor, with two kids. Now, on to the article: [http://www.musingson.com/ccCase.html A Conservative Christian Case for Civil Same-Sex Marriage]. Please, read with an open mind, and respond here.

Interesting article. I haven't read it in full yet, and need to study it more. I do have a question, however, related to the author's assertion that gays have the right to marry each other. Where do our rights come from? Our founders thought that they come from God, and I think I would tend to agree. I don't really care what a chief justice of the supreme court has to say about what my rights are. Marriage is an institution created by God, and I think God's definition of marriage is fairly clear in the Bible. So, does God give me the right to marry another man? For that matter, does God give me the right to marry my sister, my two best girlfriends, or my dog? What are my rights related to marriage, how far do they go, and why?

Well I guess I'll open up.  First off, I stand with frew and C-4, that marriage is from God, and it's for a man an a woman to be joined together as one, and it's been that way since the beginning.  The government doesn't have anything to do with it.  If you would like the insurance, next of kin, etc. rights associated with a civil union then you can get a government marriage license.  I would personally like the government to get out of the marriage business and only give out civil unions, and they can give them to anyone they want.  I really don't care if there is a group of 4 people and a llamas who want to be civilly joined with all of the insurance benefits and next of kin stuff.  If you want a marriage you go to a church.  

Now on to the next point, while I am not a homosexual, there has been no proof presented that being homosexual is not a choice.  In fact, all research on the topic that I am aware of has been decidedly the opposite.  There are a number of successful christian ministries led by ex-gays that use this as one of their chief witnessing tools.  I would call being gay more of an addiction, like alcoholism or addictions to pornography.  That doesn't mean some people are more easily addicted, or lean towards it naturally due to their upbringing, but it is still a choice.  So continued use of this argument isn't really compelling.  I mean if someone grew up in an entirely conservative chrisitan environment, home schooled, king james version only, the whole bit.  They would be extraordinarily influenced to become a similar though not forced, I realize the triggers may be different by as far as I understand the idea is the same.  This isn't to minimize their struggle, but I know personally, that in my past  i had problems with anger and violence and they're pretty natural to me.  But just because I lean towards violence doesn't make it ok.  

Finally, should gays be given the right to this civil union.  Well.. to be honest, about a month ago I would have been totally for it.  I think they are people, I think they deserve those insurance rights, I think they have a real relationship with their partner, I think while they may be sinners and living in sin, they should be able to do so if they choose and the government should treat them just like me.  I mean we don't legally remove the right of an alchoholic to purchase beer.  We don't legally remove the right of a adulterer to continue visiting his mistress.   This would have been, one month ago, my argument. 

Now, thinking especially about the [[Sin Concept]] I wonder if this is a good choice.  I mean we are legally binding someone into a sinful relationship.  And if the theory that sin harms the larger community is true, then we are just creating intentional community harm.  Alcohol can be enjoyed responsibly, no sinning, so while it can be abused we allow it (legally) because people should have freedom.  Drunk driving is illegal because you may very likely cause harm to the community as a result. So... pretty much, right now, I have no idea whether I would vote for or against same sex civil unions. --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:33, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
