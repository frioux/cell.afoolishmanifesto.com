Homosexuality.

To start off, I would like to send everyone to go and read an interesting article. Before clicking, let me preface by saying that the author is a self-confessed conservative evangelical, straight, married to a pastor, with two kids. Now, on to the article: [http://www.musingson.com/ccCase.html A Conservative Christian Case for Civil Same-Sex Marriage]. Please, read with an open mind, and respond here.
