(Note for audience: Open Source is basically a "software development model" where you give away the software and what is needed to make the software, the source code, and allow people to freely modify it themselves and either make their own version or give you the additional code so you can add their improvements.  Big examples are Linux, OpenOffice, and Firefox.  Typically companies that make open source software make money by selling support and other services that complement the software.)
(Another note for audience: Usually the way that open source projects work a small group of people do the top level design, figuring out features and big picture ideas, and then they go through and break the project down into very small parts and split them out to different people who work on them and communicate via the internet. )

I am officially a big picture kind of person.  This will probably be apparent in this post, just a forwarning.  

So I was sitting in church this morning and spacing out just a smidgeon thinking about open source/wiki technlology.  This wiki here is my first attempt at participating in the idea of "group creation" whereas I've been using open source software for quite a while now.  However, most of the current open source stuff is software, and I am by no means a computer scientist.  But I don't think it would have to remain so.  I put forth the idea of [[Corporate_Finances|community missions]] where christians would work through a school and company to build a group of people ready to accept the gospel because the christians would be helping them become self sufficient (among other reasons).  This would enable a few christian engineers, scientists, farmers and business men to participate for readily in the missions field because it would use their expertise.  But I was thinking what about all of those christians here at home that for some reason or another can't.  We have a huge work force of christian engineers, scientists, and other trades both in the US and over seas.  What about using the open source approach/business model to take advantage of those peoples skills to develope something for the third world?

I saw through the LEGS program that it is very very doable to create something that improves peoples lives, however, it requires tons and tons of time and expertise, most of which we on the LEGS team had tons of the former and none of the latter so we spent all of our time getting expertise to perform simple tasks and then moving on.  But there are christian (and non-christian) engineers out there who have expertise in all kinds of fields and access to all kinds of equipment.  They wouldn't be willing to invest 10-20 hours a week into a project, but 2-5 hours a week on a "hobby" design project?  If the tasks were split into small enough chunks, people with relevent experience/training could accomplish them quickly and painlessly, and as long as communication were good, they could easily work with collegues miles away.  

Case study:  For instance, a project I thought needed doing was a well drilling/tapping system.  Imagine a truck that was basically self sufficient that could drive around africa, drill nice deep wells, cap them off with a renewable energy system to for extracting water (maybe wind power?) and carry on to the next site.  As a big picture (think senior design project) this is way out of the league of most people's ability and or time constraints, but over the series of a few months a hundred people could put together a very nice design, and have it tested, and go through 2 or 3 design iterations over the course of just 2 or 3 years.  Then just release it via the open source license and a few guys in africa can start a business making these trucks and driving them around... Hmmmm..

Well what do you guys think?  --Goat


I think it is a great idea GOAT, but of course, I have been an Open Source man for a long time.  The problem though is this: software is relatively quick to write, so doing it in your spare time works.  On the other hand, physical things take more time to do.  I just say this because this has been tried with a portable video game console and a cell phone.  I can't remember the name of either of them, but if you searched long enough you could probably find it.  Anyway, basically by the time the phone (it was a kit) or video game system was ready, it was outdated.

Let me put it another way: you are basically saying Free (as in freedom) plans, right?  With software the plan '''is'''  the software, so it can be very easily updated.

If you think those things can be overcome that's great; this is just what I have seen in the past two or three years with the extension of Open source into more than just software.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 00:09, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

So, to answer some questions:  I am saying free as in freedom plans, but not only plans for a device.  Because the projects i have in mind are not technologically advanced (simple devices) they are not likely to become outdated.  For isntance the LEGS leg will not because outdated in 50 years because it is a physical device that works fine.  I mean gas engines have been more or less the same for as long as it's been around and they still work.  Obviously it would improve with time, but simplicity will be our friend there.  And much of the design will be small enough chunks that a competent engineer/scientists could perform the work relatively quickly.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:43, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

I think that some of this stuff actually exists (if I'm understanding you correctly Goat).  Within my work with AT (approptiate technology--stuff for 3rd world people), I've come accross interesting works dedicated to helping people oversees plan/build/design.  Alot of it, in my personal opinion, is pretty crappy.  It would be nice if some better stuff was put out (maybe it is?).  Anyways, I've come across microfiche (speeling?  I believe the LU library has it) and a CD set that has something like 100+ books on AT stuff from building a house to planting equipment.  THere are also websites dedicated to this stuff, as well as conferences.  The goals for this material is to basically be an open source to help people in the 3rd world.  MOst of this stuff is physical technologies and such.  I wonder what exists for business models or missions?  I'm sure that someone has started some of this stuff before (who knows how crappy it is though). [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 19:27, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

Huh, that brings up an interesting point, that the information is available just not being used effectively, what would happen if we made this information all computerized and availalbe to missionaries all over the world?  Maybe we just need an open source collaborative.  Like a wikipedia for the third world, fill it full of practical information and technology for the third world.  A copendium of information on farming, building, machining, health care, education, everything, and then you could include the open source technology that would be helpful for an area.  For instance, in the farming section we could have an open source design fora  better shovel or soemthing similar.. hmm... thoughts?   --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:43, 19 November 2008 (UTC)
