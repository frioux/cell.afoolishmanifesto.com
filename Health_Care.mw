There's obviously a ton of debate right now about health care, so I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts. Will the ideas being pushed right now help the health care situation, providing more for people and lowering costs? Should the government provide health care for people?

I'm against it mostly because I think our federal government is too large and does too many things as it is.  I think that our federal government has too much power and I think that as it gets more power it will continue to try to get more power.  I think our large government is a burden on our society, economy, and our lives.  Our laws are too complex to understand, so how do we keep from breaking them?  Or legislation is too long for our representatives to read, so how will we have good legislation?  I'll leave it at that for now.  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 01:02, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
