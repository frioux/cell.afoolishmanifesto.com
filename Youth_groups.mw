During our chapel devo times (sparky, frew and I) we often talked about what has caused the extreme attrition rate of young christians and the lack of strong faith in younger people in general.  Most of our conclusions revolved around the lack of discipleship which has caused the younger christians to lack the mature christian influence.  And we usually came to the conclusion on fixing that was just to get more discipleship going on in the churches.  While we addressed the cure to the problem we never looked heavily into the source.  So at the risk of being imflaminatory, I propose a possible cause for this lack of discipleship in the church:  Youth Groups.

Background:  We know that in recent years parents have taken much less intrest in raising their own kids, this is displayed by the prevelance of day care and the dependence on parents to depend on surrogates (schools and churches) to educate their children.  We also know there are exceptions, but I'm sure if someone took the time to run the math there would be an overwhelming majority of kids in situations where they are surrounded by their peers and are being educated/trained/coached/... by a single or few older authority figures, ie a class ratio of 10 to 1 or similar.  This is present in schools, churches, clubs, whatever.
We also know that the attrition rate of kids leaving for college and leaving their religion behind is extremely high.  There are also trends indicating that young people mature later, this is easily seen by looking at college freshmen/parent interactions.  (if you are a college freshman, I'm sure you'll see what I mean someday)  And the idea of "youth church" has really taken off in the past few decades.

Postulate:  I propose that one of the chief reasons for high "young christian" attrition is the prevelence of youth group style church.  Which results in immature christianity by the time most leave for college which does not give them the firm enough foundation for living on their own.

Backing:  I intend to back up this postulate with a fair bit of handwaving argument.  I have attended church through my entire upbringing, most of my highschool friends also attended church, I spent five years listening to people at LeTourneau talk about their church experience.  One of the threads I noticed was the prevelence of "youth group" church, where most people would attend spend all week at school with their peers, they would spend many evenings with their peers at church events, youth group and the like, and if they didn't go to a "youth service" they would see the older body of christ maybe once a week.  So the fraction of time spent with christians was like 90/10 with peers making up 90% and everyone else making up the other 10%.  

Now one of the reasons I believe flooders (and other places as well) are so awesome is that they force people to live with people who are different, older younger, smarter dumber, different backgrounds, different disciplines the like.  This builds both diversity and maturity because on a regular basis older residents have the opportunity to bring younger flooders up into something bigger and older than them.  It's not always enjoyable, it's not always easy, but it is good for all involved to grow.  Also, because of the diversity in age and maturity, their is the built in ability for more immature people to ask advice and guidance from those more mature because they have already passed those times in their life.  Thus removing the "blind leading the blind" of people in the same situation giving advice to each other.  

Now apply this idea to young christians in church.  Often they are entirely missing this older younger interaction (we call that discipleship) and thus tend to leave each other blindly into one ditch after another.  And even if they don't fall down they can never hope to make as much ground as if they would be led by those older and wiser.  

Next, the question is why do we do this style of ministry, where we separate the youth and pick someone fun to lead them.  I propose it is because it is both socially acceptable and easier.  The socially acceptable part is just sticking with the societal norm that young people are different than older mature people and thus it make more sense "pychologically" to put them together because they can be friends more easily.  Secondly, teenagers are annoying, whinny, and sometimes plain stupid so if we can send them off to the youth house to play video game and have emotional religious expereinces then we can study the old testament in peace, that sounds really nice.  So everyone gets what they want, we don't have to deal with those hormonally challenged and they don't have to grow up, they can stay immature with their friends as long as they want.

Finally, what is the result of this?  I think it's obvious, we as a church have accepted the worldly idea of separating into maturity level groups which allow for more fun and competely ignored the fact our young christians are still whinning for milk when they should be onto solid food.  Which finally results into christians falling away from Christ at record levels as soon as they live without mommy and daddy.

So where do we go from here, to be honest, practically, I'm not quite sure, I mean we talked a lot about how discipleship is both necessary and awesome, but I think it should probably go farther than that.  A more blended church body is probably a good thing.  I mean the quickest way I know to grow up is to spend time with grown ups.  I realize this isn't as much fun, but what are our priorities?  I also totally realize that a youth group is a great way to bring new young people into the church, but it's also a great way to show outsiders only what baby christians look like.  hmmmmmm

Caveat:  I am not against youth groups, kids camps, any of this stuff, I think they are great things and can be incredible evangelistic tools, but I think to rely on them for your christian growth (which many young christians do) is a recipe for disaster.  I mean it's great to be saved by going to camp and learning fun songs, and having an emotional experience with Jesus between water fights and getting  a crush on that cute counselor, but eventually you go home, and that high is not going to last.
