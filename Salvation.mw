So I've been reading through the gospels lately and reflecting some on the idea of salvation, and as usual i've been thinking imflammitory thoughts.  Lets talk about salvation, the mechanism, repercussions, problems, blasphemies in general...  The reason I bring this up, is that I know my thoughts have changed on this since high school, and throughout college (probably not recently)  but it's a tremendously important doctrine and has caused more divisions in the church than probably any other doctrine.  

For instance some things I wonder (and don't wonder, it's all mixed up to keep it interesting) about, sinners prayer, age of accountability, baptism, eternal security, salvation and works, confession/repentance, all of these things (and more I"m sure) have caused divisions in the church, have caused new believers/unsaved people to be very very confused and I think in some ways all of them have been maligned or marketed.  

The reason I bring this up is that now that I'm at a new school, opportunities to talk about Jesus, faith, and my life, abound.  But I'm trying to be very careful to separate american christianity branding from the real thing.  I remember very vividly how I was taught to present the gospel and to gain converts from campers while I was a camp counselor, but in retrospect I wonder what tiny precentage of campers actually benefited from it.. 

Anyways, I intentionally left out most of my thoughts or references to leave the discussion wide open, what do you guys think?

First of all, allow me to preface by saying that the way my thoughts on this topic go would probably result in me being branded as a heretic by lots of different people, and I am fully aware of this. 

The Torah contains 613 laws. The Israelites were to observe these laws as evidence of their pre-existing love and devotion to God. But, this was too hard. They decided that instead obeying the 613 laws should be the way they loved God. But the laws are so poorly defined! So they wrote some other books to figure out how to precisely obey those 613 laws--the Mishnah and the Talmud. These books are HUGE! Sometimes a single law from the Torah will have an entire volume dedicated to describing the ins and outs of how to obey it. Thus, by the time we come to Jesus, obeying the law is a science and a full time profession that only the Pharisees were able to understand and comprehend.

Now, we as Christians all know this is a bad plan. We know that Jesus came to tell people that the true purpose of the law is not for us to have a tool to demonstrate to God how much we love him, but for God to have a tool to demonstrate to us that on our own power we can't serve God. So instead, he tells us about salvation by grace. It's pretty simple, really. Throughout the gospels and the rest of the of New Testament various authors talk about this idea, nuancing it and applying it in various different contexts.

Then, Christianity does to salvation by grace exactly what the Jews did to the law. We turn it into a science. We call this science "soteriology." Nowadays, if you want to understand soteriology, you have to go to college, or read books - lots of books. We also came up with this thing called systematic theology. The science of understanding God. 

My opinion? I think that the goal did not change between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament - Love God and neighbor. It is pretty easy to know if you are doing this or not. In the New Testament, God explains to us that he doesn't want us fixating on whether or not we are obeying the law right, or dealing with sin right. He wants us fixating on whether or not we are loving. That was the point of Jesus - to free us from these other concerns. 

So, the Jews spent all their time worrying if they were obeying the law well enough. Well, nowadays it seems that lots of people within Christianity are worrying if they are saved enough.

In sum, I think "salvation" is a lot less mystical and a lot more practical. Paul said, "work out your salvation." What does it mean to be saved? It means that you aren't fixating on sin and law, but that you are trusting God that he has dealt with those things and empowered you to love more perfectly. So work this out - spend more time loving. Prove you are saved, not by coming up with a soteriological definition of salvation that includes you, but by doing what it is that God has spent the last 6000 years telling us to do.
