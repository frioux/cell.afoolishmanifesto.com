So I've been reading through the gospels lately and reflecting some on the idea of salvation, and as usual i've been thinking imflammitory thoughts.  Lets talk about salvation, the mechanism, repercussions, problems, blasphemies in general...  The reason I bring this up, is that I know my thoughts have changed on this since high school, and throughout college (probably not recently)  but it's a tremendously important doctrine and has caused more divisions in the church than probably any other doctrine.  

For instance some things I wonder (and don't wonder, it's all mixed up to keep it interesting) about, sinners prayer, age of accountability, baptism, eternal security, salvation and works, confession/repentance, all of these things (and more I"m sure) have caused divisions in the church, have caused new believers/unsaved people to be very very confused and I think in some ways all of them have been maligned or marketed.  

The reason I bring this up is that now that I'm at a new school, opportunities to talk about Jesus, faith, and my life, abound.  But I'm trying to be very careful to separate american christianity branding from the real thing.  I remember very vividly how I was taught to present the gospel and to gain converts from campers while I was a camp counselor, but in retrospect I wonder what tiny precentage of campers actually benefited from it.. 

Anyways, I intentionally left out most of my thoughts or references to leave the discussion wide open, what do you guys think?
