So I've been reading through the gospels lately and reflecting some on the idea of salvation, and as usual i've been thinking imflammitory thoughts.  Lets talk about salvation, the mechanism, repercussions, problems, blasphemies in general...  The reason I bring this up, is that I know my thoughts have changed on this since high school, and throughout college (probably not recently)  but it's a tremendously important doctrine and has caused more divisions in the church than probably any other doctrine.  

For instance some things I wonder (and don't wonder, it's all mixed up to keep it interesting) about, sinners prayer, age of accountability, baptism, eternal security, salvation and works, confession/repentance, all of these things (and more I"m sure) have caused divisions in the church, have caused new believers/unsaved people to be very very confused and I think in some ways all of them have been maligned or marketed.  

The reason I bring this up is that now that I'm at a new school, opportunities to talk about Jesus, faith, and my life, abound.  But I'm trying to be very careful to separate american christianity branding from the real thing.  I remember very vividly how I was taught to present the gospel and to gain converts from campers while I was a camp counselor, but in retrospect I wonder what tiny precentage of campers actually benefited from it.. 

Anyways, I intentionally left out most of my thoughts or references to leave the discussion wide open, what do you guys think?

First of all, allow me to preface by saying that the way my thoughts on this topic go would probably result in me being branded as a heretic by lots of different people, and I am fully aware of this. 

The Torah contains 613 laws. The Israelites were to observe these laws as evidence of their pre-existing love and devotion to God. But, this was too hard. They decided that instead obeying the 613 laws should be the way they loved God. But the laws are so poorly defined! So they wrote some other books to figure out how to precisely obey those 613 laws--the Mishnah and the Talmud. These books are HUGE! Sometimes a single law from the Torah will have an entire volume dedicated to describing the ins and outs of how to obey it. Thus, by the time we come to Jesus, obeying the law is a science and a full time profession that only the Pharisees were able to understand and comprehend.

Now, we as Christians all know this is a bad plan. We know that Jesus came to tell people that the true purpose of the law is not for us to have a tool to demonstrate to God how much we love him, but for God to have a tool to demonstrate to us that on our own power we can't serve God. So instead, he tells us about salvation by grace. It's pretty simple, really. Throughout the gospels and the rest of the of New Testament various authors talk about this idea, nuancing it and applying it in various different contexts.

Then, Christianity does to salvation by grace exactly what the Jews did to the law. We turn it into a science. We call this science "soteriology." Nowadays, if you want to understand soteriology, you have to go to college, or read books - lots of books. We also came up with this thing called systematic theology. The science of understanding God. 

My opinion? I think that the goal did not change between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament - Love God and neighbor. It is pretty easy to know if you are doing this or not. In the New Testament, God explains to us that he doesn't want us fixating on whether or not we are obeying the law right, or dealing with sin right. He wants us fixating on whether or not we are loving. That was the point of Jesus - to free us from these other concerns. 

So, the Jews spent all their time worrying if they were obeying the law well enough. Well, nowadays it seems that lots of people within Christianity are worrying if they are saved enough.

In sum, I think "salvation" is a lot less mystical and a lot more practical. Paul said, "work out your salvation." What does it mean to be saved? It means that you aren't fixating on sin and law, but that you are trusting God that he has dealt with those things and empowered you to love more perfectly. So work this out - spend more time loving. Prove you are saved, not by coming up with a soteriological definition of salvation that includes you, but by doing what it is that God has spent the last 6000 years telling us to do.

Man.. i was going to wait a week to reply.. but due to the great northeast storm thinger our power was out for a couple of days.  So anyways, unsuprisingly I am coming down somewhere near pford about salvation.  Because he's already covered the historical side ( I totally agree) I'll skip it, but I'll apply a little bit more personal application.  So I great up baptist, (the good time) and my parents stressed the personal relationship and surrender to CHrist as being teh most important factor, and this was basically sealed with a single salvation which was kind like a formalized confession/surrender/request.  Finally I was baptized as a public confession of faith.  So you could look at it as a dating relationship, leading to a proposal, leading to a wedding.  

Then as i grew older and talked to people, read books, studied my faith and really tried to learn, work, I discovered it was significantly more copmlex.  There was things like dispensationalism, calvinism, armenienism, predestination, grace, free will, all kinds of nuts and bolts of faith that we have teased apart and studied.  It's a big mess of laws and paradoxes and as lee mentioned all kinds of science and formulas (but not formulas) just really really crazy.  

So here is my current location, we as humans try to understand (us more than most being scientists and engineers) and the best way to study is to disect.  So we pull apart, make theories, test them (i'm not quite sure how), argue, debate, and try to understand.  I think it is much like science, we who are curious, try to learn, and then others are not sure how to deal with this power of knowledge.  Because there is nothing more dangerous than just a little bit of knowledge.  For instance, the power of welding, a little bit of power that has great applications for good stuff, but has also been the cause of all kind of horrible tragedies due to misapplication and misunderstanding.  In science that power of knowledge can be used for all kinds of things, ethical and not.  But with christian doctrine that power is even more ethically volatile.  Some people abuse it, some people hoard it, some people diligiently try to teach others. And it's similar again to scientific knowledge, missapplication and control problems abound.  

I'll conclude with a metaphor of marrige and science. I'd like to think that I am a pretty good engineer, I'd also like to think I came into marrige pretty circumspectly.  But the more I learn about engineering the more humble I because because the more I realize I don't know.  Marriage is the same, but worse.  I realize I don't know my wife nearly as well as I thought, I realize, marriage is significantly more complicated that I ever anticipated than I expected.  But just like welding, science and marriage, we can take a pretty simple premise, and follow it simply, humbly, and carefully and we can make something beatuiful, tremendous and really miraculous.  

I think this whole salvation thing is really really like marrage (often compared to in the bible) as something miracluous, formal, casual, simple, complex, and wholly out of our ability to understand.  We always learn new things, we always fall and get back up.. and while the simple act of a shotgun vegas wedding results in the same validity of a 5 year courtship, that's not really the point.  ANd you can commit adultry, leave, divorce, and otherwise abandon a spouse, you can still be reunited and still enjoy the same status, of course there will be scars, but that bond is pretty strong. What a mythical simple thing...--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 21:19, 14 December 2008 (UTC)


Dude, I was going to start the exact same page with the same questions.  It's so good to see that I'm not the only one thinking about this stuff.  I was thinking about salvation, faith, and works alot at the end of last semester, and several conversations with a friend made me dig a good deal around in the Bible to try to see what it says vs. what I was taught.  Like Goaticus, I was raised Baptist (Southern to be exact).  So, doing VBS (Vacation Bible School stuff) I was taught to share the gospel in the form of the ABCs (taken mostly from Rom 10:9-10): Admit, Believe, and Confess.  Another thing that I've seen while visiting all sorts of different churches is that most do not give an "alter call" or "invitation."  In the churches where I grew up, if the pastor didn't have a good reason for not giving an invitation, he would have a really angry congregation.

Here's some stuff that I've seen in scripture.  People hear about Jesus, they believe (in most cases they are baptized), and they repent.  I think that my "brand" has tried to put a nice neat little sinner's ABC prayer (the type where the one coming to Christ repeats the one "leading him" to Christ).  Where in scripture does someone become "born again" (to use Jesus' terminology in John 3 of what must take place for salvation) through a prayer?  I think that it can be an avenue, but I think that we get to tripped up over alot of this stuff.  I think the whole salvation thing is a difficult subject.  It is super complex in some respects, but a child can still understand it.

I have also spent much time dealing with the whole faith/works stuff since the summer.  I plan on starting a new discussion on it, but I do not have the time right now.  [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 00:04, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

I read some really good stuff in C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity (thanks Goat) the other night.  I think I misplaced the book, but his the general idea of what he was saying was that we know that salvation exists and comes by means of faith and such, but we don't really know how or why and some of the other details.  He says that many explanations exist for how the whole salvation thing works, but if the explanations do not work, then drop them.  He used some cool comparisons with Physics.  Models and pictures are used to describe physical phenomena.  The models and such are not exactly correct, or even what happens.  But, they are useful for our understanding.  If I find the book soon, I'll try to quote it more accurately. [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 19:51, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
