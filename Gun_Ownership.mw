I am afraid of the US government.  Not because of the new administration; I've always been afraid of the government.  But for example, why have certain leaders in the government been telling Americans that there will be a serious issue in February?  (Today is 22:51, 8 November 2008 (UTC))

I think that the right to bear arms is important in America.  I think that it is important because people need to be able to defend themselves from other people and if need be the government.   

On the other hand, I think that if the government is taking away rights, a much better way to deal with that issue is to use free speech and the press.  Like a gun, technology can be a great help with this.  Over seas internet servers and newspapers can make it nearly impossible for the government to hinder this right.

The problems is that a blog post '''after''' the black helicopters come get you is not very useful.

I think that it is fine or even advisable for most American's to have guns for this reason.  I think a background check and maybe even required training is Ok, but for the most part, people should be allowed to have guns.

So my question is, should I as a Christian own a gun?  

Jesus says that we should turn the other cheek and love our enemies; but I have heard numerous Christians (Dr. Graff for instance) who say that there is some kind of "Love Hierarchy" where your family comes first (wife then kids.)  The point being that it's ok to defend your wife if some guy comes in to rape her and kidnap your kids.  Seems reasonable to me to use a gun in such a case, but Christianity isn't often reasonable in the conventional sense, and I think that if you think it is reasonable at face value you are misunderstanding something.

Anyway, what do you guys think?  I am seriously considering buying a gun.  I wanna know what you think.  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 22:51, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

Also there are other things that I can spend my money on that would be more constructive.   [[User:Frew|Frew]] 22:56, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

Well,  allow me to preface this with "I grew up in the sticks."  Thus, I already own guns, I don't currently have any here in NY but I have a shot gun and .22 at home, hence, it's fairly obvious I think christians '''can''' own guns.  However, I think that unfortunately most people who didn't grow up with guns tend to have a more romantic view of them.  To be honest in I'm a pretty awful shot with handgun, and while I can knock down a few ducks with my shotgun, it's only got a three round magazine, meaning it would be fairly ineffective unless the bad guys tended to come at me in groups of three at close range.  And finally, in a firefight with lots of people running all over the place I have no ideas that I could effectively identify and eliminate threats without probably capping a good guy or two...However my buddy eric is a career marine with combat experience and lots and lots of time practicing with guns and would be significantly more able to defend himself with guns. (also an solid christian guy)  I realize this doesn't directly address the issue of christians with guns but I think some reason may be applicable.  It's the school yard idea of escalation of violence, if you get a fist pack the other guy gets a knife, if you get a pistol they get an assault rifle.  Finally, a weapon that you are not adequately trained with is just a liability and the likelyhood of turning your house into a fortress against the unjust legions is just ridiculous.  I mean don't get me wrong there are tons of people in my county back home with enough firearms to take on a small country and probably know how to use them so that they could hold off the black helicopters for a while but in the end they would get smoked.

I think i need to address this question both from a christian perspective and a personal one.  I think the christian question shouldn't be "should a christian own a gun" it should be more basically "should a christian defend themselves via physical violence" whether that be kung fu, drunken boxing, or a beretta.  I really wonder about that question, I'd like to think that if some was raping my wife I'd be justified when I tore them limb from limb.  I mean if we look at so many of the heros of the faith I know what they would do, David? Joshua? Moses? Samuel? Ehud?  The list goes on of biblical heros laying down the smack on evil doers, government or otherwise.  I think you could make a very convincing argument from the old testament that it is ok to kill bad people.  But the new testament?  Lots of things change, in my gut I still feel like it's ok to stop evil people with deadly force, and I know I wouldn't hesitate, but would my concience be ok with it afterwards?  

Personally, I came to the conclusion that I think its allowable for a christian to defend themselves and their family, but I struggle with the question.  

However, on the topic of guns, I think it's much easier to decide.  I say yes, if for nothing else than to exercise your right as an american so they don't take it away.  However, once obtained gun ownership bears a great responsibility, (insert relvent spiderman quote), you should be trained, you should practice, you should treat it with a great deal of respect.  It sickens me how many people die needlessly because of stupid people treating guns stupidly.  I can't emphsize how big of a deal it is to take them seriously, really.. I am rarely this serious about anything.

Finally on a personal note frew, I would be careful about buying a gun, it is a significant amount of money, and ammunition isn't cheap and if you want to be able to use the gun effectively you are going to have to go through a ton of rounds (hundreds to thousands) and finding a place to shoot may be difficult ( though I suppose C4 probably has some hook ups).  I would love to get a handgun, but I would spend a significant amount of time researching it and training with it when I got it and thus it is no where in my near future due to financial restraints.--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 03:51, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

Station on all points GOAT.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 03:57, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

I think it's just fine for Christians to own guns, but as GOAT pointed out, that's probably not the real question.  

Pretending it were, I would say emphatically yes.  Lots of people I know like to go hunting and they kill and eat deer all the time (they share it too, tastes great).

Knowing it's not, I would still say yes, it's fine for Christians to own and use guns.  As GOAT said (once again), the OT makes it clear that it is fine to defend yourself or your property if a malicious intruder ventures inward during the night.  The problem is does the NT say anything disallowing our use of force?  1 Peter 3 says to "show honor to the woman as the weaker vessel."  I certainly wouldn't let anyone lay a finger on MY weaker vessel.

As to the matter of proper gun training, I would say that if you don't know how to use one properly, you're as much a danger to yourself and those you love as you are to the person you're trying to scare off (or even potentially maim/kill).

Looking at the expenses (monetary and time-wise, as well as the danger of owning a gun around children), I would personally not get a gun.  Then again, if you're truly frightened of the government, go for it.  One of my friends has recently become firmly convinced that the 9/11 events were staged, and he's eager to discuss it whenever he can and be proven wrong.  I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted to go out and get a gun too.  Between this and the "guns on campus" crusade of last semester, is owning a gun becoming the latest Christian fad?  Like WWJD bracelets? [[User:Manhawk|Manhawk]] 20:37, 10 November 2008 (UTC)

Just a side note that I find pretty funny - gun sales have picked up *a lot* since it looked like Obama was going to be elected... :)  [[User:benjie|benjie]]

@Manhawk: does showing honor mean that though?  Jesus says to turn the other cheek.  He says that if someone asks for your cloak give them your shirt, and if they ask you to walk a mile walk two.  That's actually in the context of the govt itself.

@Benjie: here in Dallas (Fort Worth actually) there is a gun store that sold 100k worth of guns on November 5th....more than the past three years put together!

--[[User:Frew|Frew]] 17:03, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

@Frew: I wasn't addressing the issue of defending yourself against the government, I was talking about defending your household against thieves, catburglars, The Joker, etc.  

As for protection against the government, that's much more questionable (is that really the only reason you want a gun?  If it is, then I'd say get one while you can).  There may be a scenario where it is biblically justifiable to respond to the government with force (i.e., God tells you to), but the likelihood of that happening is slim.  During Jesus' time, many of the people wanted to rebel against the government that held them as slaves (I'm basing this off of the movie Spartacus), but Jesus did not take part.  In fact, when the bad people came to arrest Jesus, Peter tried to fight them off with a sword. Jesus stopped him.  These bad people had the authority of the government to back them up and they were doing something absolutely terrible, but Jesus personally permitted it.  Is there enough similarity between this and what you're saying for it to be relevant? [[User:Manhawk|Manhawk]] 00:14, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

I had no idea the spike in gun sales was so high after the election, pretty amazing.  I think basing historical thoguhts on spartacus is probably unnecessary and unrealistic.  The jews have a long history with being conquered, rising up and throwing off their oppressors, rinse and repeat.  Especially during Jesus' time because it was within a few hundred years of the macabees revolt where the jews actually did kick the romans out for a bit.  There was a fairly large sociopolitical group of people called the zealots who wanted to do exactly that again, kick the romans out by force and often did so called "terrorist" acts.  They did this more for national sovreignty (stemming from their history) than the fact the romans "kept them as slaves."  

However, as far as guns and rising up against the government and all that stuff, I find it extremely unlikely that God would want that to happen again, it seems He changed His style in the NT and would seek a grass roots effort to change people hearts rather than their government.  Personally, I find the protection of my house/family as a much more relevent issue to be addressed with a gun, but as far as tools go, they could always be used for other things.  I think if a full scale revolt happened, Christians would probably not be leading it, and we would need the guns more to protect our families from the inevitable collateral murders/rapes/pillaging.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:37, 19 November 2008 (UTC)

I stand with Goat.

Here's a couple of thoughts.  #1, I think guns are cool and don't think they should be banned.  Yeah, some people are really stupid, but let them take themselves out of the genepool!  As far as governmental things are concerned, we never see legit reasons for an overthrow.  The closes thing that I can think to that is the Exodus, and the Israelites didn't use force.  God actually used the Babalonians, Chaldeans, Assyrians (all oppressive rulers) to bring about his own desires.  Sure the Jews did have revolts later, but I'm not so sure that it was a God thing.  Also we see stuff like Ephesians 6:5-9 where Paul says that slaves should obey/submit to their masters.  I'm pretty sure that Paul thought it was best to be free, but if you're a slave, so be it.  Anyways, what I'm traying to say is that I think getting a gun to "protect yourself from the government" is silly.  If the Man wanted to kill you, you'd be screwed anyway.  Besides, is not God sovereign?

Next, I like the way that the Jews viewed the 10 Commandments.  They saw the preservation of human life more important than everything except idolatry.  You can see this from stuff like David lying to live, but the prophets of Baal being killed because of the Mount Carmel stuff (1 Kings 18).  I don't think that it is wrong to cap a bad dude that breaks into someone's house and threatens live, he just better not miss!  I think it's kinda a practicality issue.  But what if the burglar was unarmed?  

I also think it is a conscience thing.  I really think that we have the freedom to do about whatever we want, except we can't go against our conscience (Romans 14).  I think this is a legit discussion, but I think that the people that are hardcore for either having or not having guns need to chill out (I am not saying this as a response to what anyone has written on this site, really dramatic people just irritate me).
