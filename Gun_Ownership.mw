I am afraid of the US government.  Not because of the new administration; I've always been afraid of the government.  But for example, why have certain leaders in the government been telling Americans that there will be a serious issue in February?  (Today is 22:51, 8 November 2008 (UTC))

I think that the right to bear arms is important in America.  I think that it is important because people need to be able to defend themselves from other people and if need be the government.   

On the other hand, I think that if the government is taking away rights, a much better way to deal with that issue is to use free speech and the press.  Like a gun, technology can be a great help with this.  Over seas internet servers and newspapers can make it nearly impossible for the government to hinder this right.

The problems is that a blog post '''after''' the black helicopters come get you is not very useful.

I think that it is fine or even advisable for most American's to have guns for this reason.  I think a background check and maybe even required training is Ok, but for the most part, people should be allowed to have guns.

So my question is, should I as a Christian own a gun?  

Jesus says that we should turn the other cheek and love our enemies; but I have heard numerous Christians (Dr. Graff for instance) who say that there is some kind of "Love Hierarchy" where your family comes first (wife then kids.)  The point being that it's ok to defend your wife if some guy comes in to rape her and kidnap your kids.  Seems reasonable to me to use a gun in such a case, but Christianity isn't often reasonable in the conventional sense, and I think that if you think it is reasonable at face value you are misunderstanding something.

Anyway, what do you guys think?  I am seriously considering buying a gun.  I wanna know what you think.  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 22:51, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

Also there are other things that I can spend my money on that would be more constructive.   [[User:Frew|Frew]] 22:56, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

Well,  allow me to preface this with "I grew up in the sticks."  Thus, I already own guns, I don't currently have any here in NY but I have a shot gun and .22 at home, hence, it's fairly obvious I think christians '''can''' own guns.  However, I think that unfortunately most people who didn't grow up with guns tend to have a more romantic view of them.  To be honest in I'm a pretty awful shot with handgun, and while I can knock down a few ducks with my shotgun, it's only got a three round magazine, meaning it would be fairly ineffective unless the bad guys tended to come at me in groups of three at close range.  And finally, in a firefight with lots of people running all over the place I have no ideas that I could effectively identify and eliminate threats without probably capping a good guy or two...However my buddy eric is a career marine with combat experience and lots and lots of time practicing with guns and would be significantly more able to defend himself with guns. (also an solid christian guy)  I realize this doesn't directly address the issue of christians with guns but I think some reason may be applicable.  It's the school yard idea of escalation of violence, if you get a fist pack the other guy gets a knife, if you get a pistol they get an assault rifle.  Finally, a weapon that you are not adequately trained with is just a liability and the likelyhood of turning your house into a fortress against the unjust legions is just ridiculous.  I mean don't get me wrong there are tons of people in my county back home with enough firearms to take on a small country and probably know how to use them so that they could hold off the black helicopters for a while but in the end they would get smoked.

I think i need to address this question both from a christian perspective and a personal one.  I think the christian question shouldn't be "should a christian own a gun" it should be more basically "should a christian defend themselves via physical violence" whether that be kung fu, drunken boxing, or a beretta.  I really wonder about that question, I'd like to think that if some was raping my wife I'd be justified when I tore them limb from limb.  I mean if we look at so many of the heros of the faith I know what they would do, David? Joshua? Moses? Samuel? Ehud?  The list goes on of biblical heros laying down the smack on evil doers, government or otherwise.  I think you could make a very convincing argument from the old testament that it is ok to kill bad people.  But the new testament?  Lots of things change, in my gut I still feel like it's ok to stop evil people with deadly force, and I know I wouldn't hesitate, but would my concience be ok with it afterwards?  

Personally, I came to the conclusion that I think its allowable for a christian to defend themselves and their family, but I struggle with the question.  

However, on the topic of guns, I think it's much easier to decide.  I say yes, if for nothing else than to exercise your right as an american so they don't take it away.  However, once obtained gun ownership bears a great responsibility, (insert relvent spiderman quote), you should be trained, you should practice, you should treat it with a great deal of respect.  It sickens me how many people die needlessly because of stupid people treating guns stupidly.  I can't emphsize how big of a deal it is to take them seriously, really.. I am rarely this serious about anything.

Finally on a personal note frew, I would be careful about buying a gun, it is a significant amount of money, and ammunition isn't cheap and if you want to be able to use the gun effectively you are going to have to go through a ton of rounds (hundreds to thousands) and finding a place to shoot may be difficult ( though I suppose C4 probably has some hook ups).  I would love to get a handgun, but I would spend a significant amount of time researching it and training with it when I got it and thus it is no where in my near future due to financial restraints.--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 03:51, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

Station on all points GOAT.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 03:57, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

I think it's just fine for Christians to own guns, but as GOAT pointed out, that's probably not the real question.  

Pretending it were, I would say emphatically yes.  Lots of people I know like to go hunting and they kill and eat deer all the time (they share it too, tastes great).

Knowing it's not, I would still say yes, it's fine for Christians to own and use guns.  As GOAT said (once again), the OT makes it clear that it is fine to defend yourself or your property if a malicious intruder ventures inward during the night.  The problem is does the NT say anything disallowing our use of force?  1 Peter 3 says to "show honor to the woman as the weaker vessel."  I certainly wouldn't let anyone lay a finger on MY weaker vessel.

As to the matter of proper gun training, I would say that if you don't know how to use one properly, you're as much a danger to yourself and those you love as you are to the person you're trying to scare off (or even potentially maim/kill).

Looking at the expenses (monetary and time-wise, as well as the danger of owning a gun around children), I would personally not get a gun.  Then again, if you're truly frightened of the government, go for it.  One of my friends has recently become firmly convinced that the 9/11 events were staged, and he's eager to discuss it whenever he can and be proven wrong.  I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted to go out and get a gun too.  Between this and the "guns on campus" crusade of last semester, is owning a gun becoming the latest Christian fad?  Like WWJD bracelets? [[User:Manhawk|Manhawk]] 20:37, 10 November 2008 (UTC)
