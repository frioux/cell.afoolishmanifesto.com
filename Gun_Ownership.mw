I am afraid of the US government.  Not because of the new administration; I've always been afraid of the government.  But for example, why have certain leaders in the government been telling Americans that there will be a serious issue in February?  (Today is 22:51, 8 November 2008 (UTC))

I think that the right to bear arms is important in America.  I think that it is important because people need to be able to defend themselves from other people and if need be the government.   

On the other hand, I think that if the government is taking away rights, a much better way to deal with that issue is to use free speech and the press.  Like a gun, technology can be a great help with this.  Over seas internet servers and newspapers can make it nearly impossible for the government to hinder this right.

The problems is that a blog post '''after''' the black helicopters come get you is not very useful.

I think that it is fine or even advisable for most American's to have guns for this reason.  I think a background check and maybe even required training is Ok, but for the most part, people should be allowed to have guns.

So my question is, should I as a Christian own a gun?  


Jesus says that we should turn the other cheek and love our enemies; but I have heard numerous Christians (Dr. Graff for instance) who say that there is some kind of "Love Hierarchy" where your family comes first (wife then kids.)  The point being that it's ok to defend your wife if some guy comes in to rape her and kidnap your kids.  Seems reasonable to me to use a gun in such a case, but Christianity isn't often reasonable in the conventional sense, and I think that if you think it is reasonable at face value you are misunderstanding something.

Anyway, what do you guys think?  I am seriously considering buying a gun.  I wanna know what you think.  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 22:51, 8 November 2008 (UTC)
