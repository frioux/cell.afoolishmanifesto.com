This kinda stuff came up in church last week.  So, I was born and raised believing in hardcore freewill, and looked down on anyone who even thought of predestination.  But, as the years went on, and I studied and memorized more scripture, the more I realized that maybe it wasn't exactly like I was taught.  So, Suday the sermon was over the angels getting Lot out of Sodom in Gen 19 (vv15-39 or so).  So, the angels told him that he needed to get his family and get out of town (Lot is called "righteous Lot" in the NT).  Let's suppose that Lot had complete free will.  Lot would have roasted, and there's no question about it.  Lot had to be literally seized and led out of the city by physical force.  Why?  God chose it that way (the influence of Abraham and the idea of the elect come in to play here or something like that).  The angels weren't like chillin', they were ready to light the place up, and Lot was in the way.  Also, the angels didn't have an evangelistic conference in Sodom and give an alter call.  

Here's two verses that used to give me some trouble in my 100% free will days. "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.  And I will raise him up on the last day" John 6:44.  We might technically have the option to pick Jesus, but #1 I think that we'd rather live in Sodom like Lot, and #2 the Father has to draw us.  I think that we have to have the grace of God behind us if we are going to be able to pick him, and if God is drawing (maybe dragging like Lot) us, can we overpower him?  I don't think we can.  "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit..." John 15:16a.  

Here's one of the verses that is used on the other side of the argument that I think needs a second look.  In 2 Peter 3, Peter is talking to believers (see vv1,8).  He says in verse 9, "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you (remember he is talking to believers), not wishing that any (I think I hold that this "any" are the elect, not all people on earth) should perish, but that all (elect) should reach repentance."  He then continues talking to believers (or elect, I'm not sure at this point what is meant or what I believe exactly) afterward.  So, it seems to me that he is talking about believers/elect only here.  God is not waiting for everyone inhabiting the earth to come to salvation.  

So, here's a few of my current, and probably provocative, thoughts on the matter.  What do you guys see in all of this stuff?  Am I going off in left field?[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 02:11, 4 February 2009 (UTC)


I think you have some good scripture here Sparky, but I think you are kinda twisting that last scripture with a lot of parentheticals.  The way you are looking at it does make it apply more to eternal security, but why do you think he is talking about the elect there?  Is that just a gut feeling?  If so I wouldn't go so far as to interpret the scripture inside the reference like you have.  If you have stronger reasons for saying that the people referred to here are the ones God has chosen then by all means tell us why.  I agree with you to an extent, but I think you are going too far in that direction.  I'll post on this with my thoughts soon; but I'm too busy at work at the moment.  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 19:25, 4 February 2009 (UTC)


I'm gonna cast my vote with Frew on this one.  First off, this sounds like a not completely thought through post (not a bad thing just an observation) and espeically the bit about inserting parantheticals into scripture.  Secondly, you need to make a relively large differentiation between free will/predestination vs the eternal security.  People have differeing beliefs on eternal security on both sides of the predestination fence.  

Personally I come down on the side of a crazy hard to understand tension between free will and predestination that equals in the end a salavation that cannot be lost by an action.  I would base this on a number of things.  I think there is quite a body of scripture that makes clear we have to choose Christ, for instance a bunch of Jesus' miracles were to people that had faith in Him and chose to seek him out.  There is also a bunch of scripture that infers that some of our coming to Christ has little to do with ourselves, the good and the bad dirt (how can dirt make a choice), the references to "having ears but not able to hear," and the one you mentioned about no one can come unless the father draws him (directly after the ears thing I mentioned).  So I think it's apparent that there is some sort of combination or something that synergizes those different view points into a coherent thing.  And I also personally thing that particular thing is probably outside of our mental faculties because of our inherent dependence on time vs God who has no such restraints. 

Finally, I think the idea of eternal security is one that is tied more to Gods choice than man's.  For instance, John 10:28-30, says that no one can snatch those who are Christ's out of his hands.  I think that that makes it fairly clear that nothing can separate us from the Grace of God.  The only thing that might screw up that thought is the diea of a volitional departure from following Christ.  However, I'm not sure how possible that is.  I've only ever heard it argued from a theoretical viewpoint and because you can only konw your own heart I'm not sure that even anecdotal evidence would support the idea that someone "who was truely a christian" walked away from the faith.  

Anyways, that's my two cents... charis kai eirene.  --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 22:35, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
