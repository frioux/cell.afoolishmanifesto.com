Tares in the Church:
Matthew 13:24-30 (maybe elsewhere?)

So I was reading through this passage and it struck me how wise this passage is.  Allow me to expound, so in a church we can only be assured of our own salavation and not of other people, but as humans we often look to other humans as examples and thus their sucess and failure affects our own.  I mean, for instance people look at their pastor as the epitomy of a good christian, and thus if the pastor can do it, or maybe that person who came from a worse background than you can make it as a christian we are encouraged that we can also do this hard christian walk.  

Now in the parable of the tares, these guys notice that an enemy has planted tares (a poisonous weed that looks kinda like wheat) in the wheat fields and asks the master what they should do about it.  And he says to leave them there and we'll separate them and burn them come harvest time.  The reason we don't take care of them now is because you'll end up pulling up some good wheat along with the tares if we pull them now.  So heres the jump, current events: megachurch pastor is discovered to have relationship with male prostitutes, catholic priests discovered to be pedaphiles, the list goes on. Now we as christians have a responsibility to reveal the truth right?  What if by revealing the truth and "casting out the wicked one" you have some collateral damage to good christians?  So now I see why this is such an interesting parable, God allows "false sheep" if you will to live, grow, and flourish in the church so that He doesn't lose the collateral by ousting them.  So we as christians face an even bigger challenge, how do we deal with a "sinning brother?"  

I think we should weigh the damage they are currently doing (pedaphile preists" with the damage that would be done by excising them and act wisely from there.  But imagine (especially as a new christian) your pastor was secretly into illicit sex and child pornography, from your perspective would you be better off knowing the truth and ousting the imposter, or not?  I mean if you left that church and were uplifted and challenged and improved by the teaching of the bastard would it matter (to you) if he was a collossal sinner.  

Hmm... I think it probably falls into that category of where Jesus tells his diciples to not rebuke those people who were preaching Jesus for the wrong reason.  While their souls are rotting, they are causing good, hmm... crazy...

Interesting.  I want to think about this some more.  We all screw up too, but where is the dividing line?  Here's some verses that I thought of while reading you post.  Phil 1:15-18.  People preach Christ different ways, and some even wrong.  But Christ is still preached, and where his word is spoken, it will not return void (Isa 55:10-11)[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 18:26, 18 September 2008 (UTC)
