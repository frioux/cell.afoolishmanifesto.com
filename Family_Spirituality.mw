So, I've been thinking alot the past several years about things concerning family spirituality.  I've been thinking a ton about it recently since I'm close to the point that I will be looking for a wife, and the fact that my church is super awesome when it comes to family spirituality.  Anyways, I've been talking to people on an individual basis about things, and I thought it would be much for beneficial to start a post.  

My backgound with family spirituality pretty much consists of going to church and praying before meals.  I know there's more than this, and I want more than this, but I don't think many families really do anything together these days.  One of the big things that I'm going to do is family devos.  I think I'm getting alot better idea of what devos should be like from talking to people and experienceing other families' devos.  The latest thing that I've been thinking about is a family mission statement.  So, my question is #1 how many of your families had mission statements, #2 how useful do you think that they can be, and #3 any other helpful sundry stuf.  Also, what is everyones experiences/thoughts on catechisms? [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 17:29, 22 May 2009 (UTC)


So maybe I'm just a cynic, but a Family Mission Statement sounds really campy to me.  I mean, I understand you and your wife having goals, a plan, whatever.  But a Mission Statement?  Are you a camp?  Are you a high school?  A year of the LETU senate?  I think it would be something that you would think back on and laugh at yourself about.

As for the catechisms, I personally don't know them all, and when I first heard them I thought they were lame.  As I grew in faith I thought more and more that they are good.  They are like fully derived equations without the work that went into them.  Maybe good to see how others thought, but what real benefit do they have if they don't provide understanding, just answers?  Does that make sense?  I think you should start with the bible is all, if you need more, go ahead.

My mom prayed for us every night when we went to bed, and that was pretty cool.  And also mom would talk with us (kinda how we did during "chapel") about devos...  Not as much in a teaching way, but more a "check how awesome God is" way.  I don't know if it was the best or the worst or whatever, but I got a really good feel for the awe of God from that.  Not the best knowledge as I only remember a few stories (lazarus in heaven was one) but I still think it is part of your complete daily breakfa-...devo.

I '''am''' curious what you other guys think about the Mission Statement thing.  Am I the only one who thinks it sounds silly?  Benjie?  GOAT?  --[[User:Frew|Frew]] 06:25, 23 May 2009 (UTC)


My family has never had a family mission statement, so I'm not familiar with what it would look like. Just thinking about it, I'm not sure what I would put in it to be general enough but also say something meaningful that's not too limited. Have you heard of what some families have used?

I haven't had much exposure to catechisms, either. Once my parents had us memorize one question/answer when we were in the dorm at boarding school. I've also memorized a bit at Christian schools here in the US. I think catechisms can be helpful, but I would definitely put more focus on memorizing Bible verses.

My family has had family devos since before I was born, and that's actually the setting where my sister and I became Christians. I think devos are a great time for the family to grow spiritually, but also just stay close as a family. Kids can comfortably ask questions in that context, too.

My family has also memorized Bible verses together since we were very young, and those passages still stick with me. It doesn't work as well when the kids go off to college (and in our situation, boarding school made it a bit difficult, too).

Just some thoughts... [[User:Benjie|Benjie]] 01:26, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
