So, I've been thinking alot the past several years about things concerning family spirituality.  I've been thinking a ton about it recently since I'm close to the point that I will be looking for a wife, and the fact that my church is super awesome when it comes to family spirituality.  Anyways, I've been talking to people on an individual basis about things, and I thought it would be much for beneficial to start a post.  

My backgound with family spirituality pretty much consists of going to church and praying before meals.  I know there's more than this, and I want more than this, but I don't think many families really do anything together these days.  One of the big things that I'm going to do is family devos.  I think I'm getting alot better idea of what devos should be like from talking to people and experienceing other families' devos.  The latest thing that I've been thinking about is a family mission statement.  So, my question is #1 how many of your families had mission statements, #2 how useful do you think that they can be, and #3 any other helpful sundry stuf.  Also, what is everyones experiences/thoughts on catechisms? [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 17:29, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
