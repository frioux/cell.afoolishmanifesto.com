<big> ''' Prayer''' </big>

We also talked about using this page for prayer requests, so now we can... tada!

'''Instructions (please read!)'''

Remember, this information is publically accessable on the internet, don't put anything on here you feel uncomfortable with the whole world knowing.  The way we used todo this on the floor is to post prayer requests (either sign or don't) and then every time someone would pray for them they would add a hash mark so that the requestor would know how many times it had been prayed for.  

'''Example'''
Pray for goat to do well in grad school (he's having a hard time) --[[User:Goat|Goat]] 16:50, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

Thus showing it has been prayed for three times, neat huh.
