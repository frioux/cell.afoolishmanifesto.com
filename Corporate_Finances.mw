I'm going to toss in my two cents here, as this is something that I have spent considerable time thinking about in the past. Let's take the example of Torola, El Salvador, where I currently live. We have a catholic church. We have a community center. We have a big assemblies of God church which is replacing a smaller one. There is a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall. There is a "Luz del Mundo" (Light of the World) church. All of the people in Torola, if they were to come together, could not fill all of these buildings at the same time. All of these buildings are in need of repairs (or being finished, in the case of the Assemblies of God church). Except for two or three times a year, there is never a group of people in any one these buildings that could not fit in any of the others. Five big buildings which stand empty for most of the week. 

Also, Torola is the poorest town in the entire country of El Salvador, which is a pretty poor country. Everyday a stream of beggars comes through the mayor's office where I work, asking for dimes so they can buy two tortillas. If they get their two tortillas, they will probably be all they eat for the day. I see children with no shoes, wearing the same clothes day after day. I walk by houses made of bamboo with plastic garbage bags for roofs. I have students who might not be able to come to school next year because the money they would spend on notebooks and pencils will have to be spent on food instead.

Where am I going with this? Let's estimate that each of those five buildings cost $10,000 (a low estimate). What if we only had one, and made it a little nicer and a little more complete? Let's say we spent $15,000. That would leave us with $35,000. Now, a recent census determined that $120 feeds one family for a month in Torola. So $35,000 could feed a couple dozen families for a year. 

Let's expand this example a little bit. How many hundreds of millions of churches are there in this world that stand empty six days a week?

In the United States, people die of cancer and heart attacks. Nobody in Torola really understand what those things are, because people don't live long enough to suffer from such diseases. People here die of malnutrition, diarrhea, and the flu.

Now, I'm not trying to be a complete downer. As I hinted, my suggestion is this: Why can't church congregations share sanctuaries? Well that would require cooperation, understanding, putting the needs of others before yourself, loving your enemy, etc.

I agree with Sparky. I think that artful, well-designed, uplifting church buildings are a good idea. I went to the Vatican last year, and was really blown away by how that art drew my soul into a worshipful mood.

I just don't think that every single congregation in this world needs to spend the money to build one.

Super interesting.  I agree that not all churches should be built like that.  I used to look down on the churches that were decorative at all, and praised the ones that had sheet metal siding/roofs.  I don't think that is a good thing either.  Also, I think different "styles" of worship might be more inclined to a more decorative building etc.  I used to think that every church should make the cheapest building they could.  I now disagree with that position.[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 15:56, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

I totally agree that the world could probably use a few less church buildings ( why can't we learn to share) but it would be worth considering this, some churches are busy all week long (becci's church back home) and some churches rent space (my [church|terranovachurch.org] is rents a local concert venue).  And finally, not to be a jerk, but donating all that money to people is not neccessarily your best bet long term anyways.  The situation we see in africa is that billions and billions of dollars are poured in to feed people and to house people and care for sick people, and yet, they are not in any better shape than they were 50 years ago.  The reason being is they've become dependent on foreign aid, and now they won't help themselves.  I totally understand that we as churches need to be willing to give to feed people, and to cloth people, but we also need to be wise.  It's that old saying about teaching a man to fish, maybe we need to teach a country how to industrialize....--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 22:37, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

Good call Goaticus.  So here's a big question that's somewhat tied to the finance post.  What do we do with our $$$$?  [[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 06:02, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

I understand what you're saying goat. I am certainly not one who thinks we should just give money to people. Though it is often hard to resist, I don't give nickels out to the beggars here. Before too long, I'd be known as the gringo who hands out nickels, and then I wouldn't really be able to get much work done. While I used the illustration of taking the saved money and spending it on food, I certainly don't advocate give-aways. A verse comes to mind... "Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need" (Ephesians 4:8). Take that money and build a community garden where people can learn how to make their land more productive... start a community insurance policy for when disaster strikes... send kids to school... etc. 

As far as teaching nations to industrialize, that is not so simple as it may seem, and the main problem is industrialized nations. Consider how southeast Asia was raped by industrialized nations for cheap labor... yeah, there is "industry" there now, but generations are excluded from it because instead of going to school, they worked in sweat shops their whole lives. El Salvador has a pretty big banking industry, and a brewery that supplies several other Central American countries. There are coffee processing plants also, and call centers. But all of these are owned by other countries. El Salvador gets wages through labor, but to encourage investment, the government doesn't tax these industries. When the breweries were sold to the tune of several hundred million dollars, not one penny of that was collected by the government in taxes. So the net result is worse in some ways. Standard of living is improved slightly, but overall development - or increase in the population's ability to improve its own standard of living - is not. Kids don't go to college, because if they can speak English they can get a good job right out of high school. Or they can work in some plant somewhere. Oh, also, El Salvador is the most violent country in the world of those countries which are not currently at war. Who commits all of these atrocities? Gangs which were formed in Los Angeles and then deported.

So, again, in hopes of turning to a more positive note, in response to Sparky's question, what should we do with our money? Look into micro-finance operations, such as [http://www.opportunity.org/ Opportunity.org]. They provide loans to innovative poor folks so they can start a business and then pay back the loan over time. Go to the [https://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=resources.donors.contribute.donatenow Peace Corps Partnership] page and look into funding Peace Corps Volunteer projects around the world (like [https://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=resources.donors.contribute.projDetail&projdesc=519-112 this one] which will fund scholarships for some of the girls I work with).

Are you guys cool with me moving this content to a Finance specific page?  I agree it's related to Cathedral stuff but it might be nice to have it on it's own page.  [[User:Frew|Frew]] 15:58, 28 October 2008 (UTC)
