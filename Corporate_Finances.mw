I'm going to toss in my two cents here, as this is something that I have spent considerable time thinking about in the past. Let's take the example of Torola, El Salvador, where I currently live. We have a catholic church. We have a community center. We have a big assemblies of God church which is replacing a smaller one. There is a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall. There is a "Luz del Mundo" (Light of the World) church. All of the people in Torola, if they were to come together, could not fill all of these buildings at the same time. All of these buildings are in need of repairs (or being finished, in the case of the Assemblies of God church). Except for two or three times a year, there is never a group of people in any one these buildings that could not fit in any of the others. Five big buildings which stand empty for most of the week. 

Also, Torola is the poorest town in the entire country of El Salvador, which is a pretty poor country. Everyday a stream of beggars comes through the mayor's office where I work, asking for dimes so they can buy two tortillas. If they get their two tortillas, they will probably be all they eat for the day. I see children with no shoes, wearing the same clothes day after day. I walk by houses made of bamboo with plastic garbage bags for roofs. I have students who might not be able to come to school next year because the money they would spend on notebooks and pencils will have to be spent on food instead.

Where am I going with this? Let's estimate that each of those five buildings cost $10,000 (a low estimate). What if we only had one, and made it a little nicer and a little more complete? Let's say we spent $15,000. That would leave us with $35,000. Now, a recent census determined that $120 feeds one family for a month in Torola. So $35,000 could feed a couple dozen families for a year. 

Let's expand this example a little bit. How many hundreds of millions of churches are there in this world that stand empty six days a week?

In the United States, people die of cancer and heart attacks. Nobody in Torola really understand what those things are, because people don't live long enough to suffer from such diseases. People here die of malnutrition, diarrhea, and the flu.

Now, I'm not trying to be a complete downer. As I hinted, my suggestion is this: Why can't church congregations share sanctuaries? Well that would require cooperation, understanding, putting the needs of others before yourself, loving your enemy, etc.

I agree with Sparky. I think that artful, well-designed, uplifting church buildings are a good idea. I went to the Vatican last year, and was really blown away by how that art drew my soul into a worshipful mood.

I just don't think that every single congregation in this world needs to spend the money to build one.

Super interesting.  I agree that not all churches should be built like that.  I used to look down on the churches that were decorative at all, and praised the ones that had sheet metal siding/roofs.  I don't think that is a good thing either.  Also, I think different "styles" of worship might be more inclined to a more decorative building etc.  I used to think that every church should make the cheapest building they could.  I now disagree with that position.[[User:Sparky|Sparky]] 15:56, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

I totally agree that the world could probably use a few less church buildings ( why can't we learn to share) but it would be worth considering this, some churches are busy all week long (becci's church back home) and some churches rent space (my [church|terranovachurch.org] is rents a local concert venue).  And finally, not to be a jerk, but donating all that money to people is not neccessarily your best bet long term anyways.  The situation we see in africa is that billions and billions of dollars are poured in to feed people and to house people and care for sick people, and yet, they are not in any better shape than they were 50 years ago.  The reason being is they've become dependent on foreign aid, and now they won't help themselves.  I totally understand that we as churches need to be willing to give to feed people, and to cloth people, but we also need to be wise.  It's that old saying about teaching a man to fish, maybe we need to teach a country how to industrialize....--[[User:Goat|Goat]] 22:37, 27 October 2008 (UTC)
