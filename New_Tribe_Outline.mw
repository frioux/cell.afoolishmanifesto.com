This is the basic outline of each lesson, and the style of teaching that we'll be doing:

There are three "zones" we specifically address, and we look over the passage for each of these, of course some passages don't nicely fit into them.. but it's a systematized approach nonetheless.  (order is inconsequential)

''"Blue Zone"''

The blue zone is the mystical, deep, theological side of a text.  Or, in normal person speak its the theological significance, especially relating to describing the character of God.  This could include theological constructs (example:predestination) as well as attributes of God (He's totally awesome, and Just, and etc.)  This can get pretty deep into theology, basically as deep as I feel like going, which is cool, because as I'm realizing, part of what made our discussion in small group and chapel skippers, is that we had a good groundwork of theology, so we could talk about the deep interesting stuff, and not just the cheesy sunday school stuffs.  Thusly, this will be lots of big questions, and deep thoughts.

''"Red Zone"''

This is the personal layer.  How does this scripture apply personally, should it change my actions, make me thankful, kick me in the rear, etc.  It's not necessarily practical, because it may only address the intellectual side of personal impact, but it affects me.  So for instance; fREW and I once had a discussion about communion and he proposed (I believe rightly) that the main personal response to communion should be extraordinary gratefulness.  Doesn't really say much about the theology of God, or relate to other people, but is purely a "me" kinda realization.

''"Green Zone"''

This is the community/output layer.  What does this scripture mean for my actions towards other things, should it be galvanizing me into action, is it telling me to stop being a jerk to people, is it telling me to kick people in the rear.  How does it affect me socially.  This was very apparent on the floor, when we discussed the theology of purity, talked about its personal meaning in our communication, and then applied it to our conversations, we were bringing the concept all the way to the green level.  This may mean giving money, it may entail helping others, calling out others, etc.  It's the feet of the body, where the red zone is the body, and the blue zone is the head.  


''Bible Study Order''

Week Before:

Questions go out about a week in advance to allow people to dig into the word and content a little early, often this doesn't actually affect people much, but it's worth a shot.  If nothing else, you can usually count on some people to read it so you have good "thinking" style questions.

Night of:

Worship: 

This is often just a psalm or song, I'm curious about being creative with this, if this outline thing works, then you'll see if I ever come up with somthing new and exciting. 

Study:

This would be where my notes and scripture references are going through the different zones.  I'm not sure it it will end up being in outline format a full text of what I want to cover.  Because much of the study works on a question and answer style format, it may not be possible to completely lay it out.  Hopefully I'll have a few diagrams to draw on a white board...  The idea excites me... probably no formulas.. but deffinetly some graphs.  

Prayer:

Hmm self explanatory.

Snacks:  

I'll leave this part out.. sorry guys, no brownies over the internet.  


PS:  I realize that this is pretty laid out already, but if anyone has an idea or two, I'm open, we can make this pretty personal so I hope to really own it.
