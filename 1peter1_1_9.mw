''Prerequisites:''

As this is the first bible study that I'll be giving to this group and Becci and I are also new to the group, I think it is important to give a little bit of a background on myself so that they'll know a little more about where we're coming from.

''About us:''

I grew up (mostly) in Tillamook, OR; which is about 1.5 hours west from Portland, about 10 minutes from the mountains or the beach. I grew up spending lots of time outdoors, playing sports, exploring, as well as lots of time in the books. I have two loving christian parents, both of which have degrees in various sciences, geology, ichthelology, biology, etc.  I have 2 brothers, one older and one younger.  My other brother is married to a Ukrainian girl he met in the peace corp and just moved to DC to take a job with the state department and my younger brother is studying music education back in oregon.
  
I went to LeTourneau University, where I recieved a double degree in Mechanical and Materials Joining engineering.  However, more importantly, I lived in one of the most amazing communities I've ever seen.  I spent lots of time in study, working along others, and slaving in the lab.  Those who have recieved an engineering degree with honors understand the baptismal of flames they must undergo in order to finish.  I consider myself a pragmatic intellectual, and I value diligence, conservation, and community.  

My (actual) relationship with Christ started in Highschool while I was working at a christian camp, and have followed Him ever since, I've been through various phases of, I've read lots of books, I've studied lots of things, and I've been many places.  I don't say this to boast, but merely to give you a taste of me.  Perspective is important, it colors our viewpoint on things, it influences our decisions, flavors our understading, and it's important to remember that.  

I met Becci at LeTourneau and we started dating within a semester or meeting.  We were married (barely, I almost got stuck in Africa) May 30 2008, and what can I say.. being married is awesome, hard, but awesome.

Oh.. side note, I absolutely love culture references, don't know why.. just do.. you get extra points if you catch them, the points are not redeemable for anything, sorry.

''Perspective''

There is a song by a band (one of my favorites) called Five Iron Frenzy called Dandelion, it goes a little like this:

In a field of yellow flowers, 
underneath the sun, 
bluest eyes that spark with lightning, 
boy with shoes undone. 
He is young, so full of hope, 
reveling in tiny dreams, 
filling up, his arms with flowers, 
right for giving any queen. 

Running to her beaming bright, 
while cradling his prize. 
A flickering of yellow light, 
within his mother's eyes. 
She holds them to her heart, 
keeping them where they'll be safe, 
clasped within her very marrow, 
dandelions in a vase. 

She sees love, where anyone else would see weeds. 
all hope is found.
Here is everything he needs. 

I find that much of life is colored by our perspective on it, a simple event can be looked at so many ways it's mind boggling.  And this means that it's important to know where we come from so that we can understand why and how we see things.  The initial readers/writers of the Gospel knew this and when the scriptures were written they were written for a specific group of people, often for a specfic purpose, and we would do well to remember that.  Something I will try to do as this study continues, is to give you a bit of a picture of the people this letter was written to, as well as the writers perspective.  It's very easy to make snap judgements and even easier to come to false conclusions if we are not careful with our perspectives on things.  For example, Mormons often use the same vocabulary as Christians, but with a totally different dictionary, and so in a conversation you may end up convincing a Mormon that you believe they are correct!  Thusly,be cognizent of perspectives, because it's so easy to gloss over things because they were written to people who worked, and played, and lived 2000 years ago.  Don't be so quick to dismiss things, it's in the bible because it's important.

''"Theology"''

Begin crushing talk on extraordinarily difficult topic.  In my case this will be using power supply control to manipulate welding for different materials.  Hopefully there will be graphs and equations and greek letters and all of that nasty stuff.  The goal will be to completely confuse them, while at the same time providing a brief lecture that a materials joining/materials engineer could easily understand.  

Did anyone understand what I was saying?  Anyone?  Hmmm.. funny, it was all very clear I thought, and so did the person I ran it by at school...  In fact I would even propose that it was elegant, beautiful and simple.  Heres the problem, none of you all had the necessary background to understand it, the basics weren't there.  The tools weren't in your tool box to piece together the various philisophical and scientific constructs that I just went through.  While you could weld without knowing what I just talked about (did you catch it was about welding?)  it would greatly add to your ability to fully understand my talk.  

Theology is kind of like that, it's not strictly neccesary for you to be a "christian,"(reference thief on the cross) to know very much theology.  But if you expect to grow very much, or be really able to dive into it, you'll need to put the time in to learn it.  Being able to knit together different theological constructs, think critically about sermons, question bible studies (like mine), and basically think for yourself is a valuable thing.  If you haven't noticed most of the new testament is about theology, there are practical sections, (james for instance) but in general, it's theological.  The reason is simple, if you really really grasp the theory, then you just need practice to master things.  It's like learning a sport, you first learn the technique and then you practice it.  The better you understand the technique from the outset the faster you will be able to master it.  We tend to be lazy about our theology in the united states, we like 4 steps to a better prayer life, or 6 steps to a better marriage, or the prayer of jabez, or a million other gimmicks.  But these are like treating the symptons, instead of treating the disease, we're broken, shattered, tired, lazy, and messed up people, the better grasp we get on who God is, who we are and the relation between us, the better we'll get at all of those symptoms.  This isn't to say that those gimmicks aren't useful, practicality is good, but it's not going to fix all of our problems.  Things that are worth having seldom come easy.  

The final note on theology is this: be humble.  People have been arguing, fighting (wars even) and dicussing theology for a very long time, and odds are people that are smarter and better read than you or I have come up with some good ideas.  Don't try to develop your theology in a vacuum, but do be critical.  Remember, much of theology is what people have learned by studying the bible, and while their results are probably pretty good, they are probably close ezekial's exclamations, "it was like, it was like, it looked like, etc"  That doesn't mean we can neglect it, nor does it mean we can reject it.  But there is room for thoughful discussion, and remember to be Humble.. please, for a while I was a non-humble theologian, and I've met plenty, and they're usualy jerks...

''Blue Zone''

Verses 1-2:

When you look at verse 2 you see that first description of the audience is "elect or chosen," selected by God the father.  The foreknowledge mentioned is not just being aware of an event or a person before hand, rather it discusses the idea of an intimate knowledge of someone (like husband and wife) before hand.  Meaning in infinity past God the father knew us intimately and well.  The sanctification of the spirit is basically the process of being set apart from the world.  I imagine it like a dinosaur stuck in a Tar pit, the process of removing it from that tar pit is a long arduous, sometimes painful process, and as it continues, the chunks of tar being removed are becoming smaller, and more detailed, but because the tar was such an all encompassing issue, its going to be a continual process of removing it.  And the greek word here is an active indicative word, infering that this in an ongoing continual type process.  

This is an interesting concept because the process of salvation is often split into a number of phases, foreknowledge, justification, sanctification, and glorification.  This is one place where we see the differet persons of the trinity performing different sections of this action.  In fact the sanctification of the Spirit is followed by the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ, which is an interesting order.  Because it's infering that while the act of justification is already done, we are constantly learning obedience and are recieving the sprinkling of the blood.

One final note on the sprinkling on the blood on people.  This occurs in scripture in only a three cases, covenent initiation ceremoney on mount siani (Exodus 24:5-8), the ceremony of ordination for aaron and his sons as priests (Exodus 29:21), and purification ceremony for a leper or other skin diseases serious enough for separateion (Leviticus 14:6-7).  In peter this most certainly is refering to the final case, where the believer has been separated from the body(fellowship wise).  This doesn't mean physical defilment of spiritual defilment due to sin.  It's not a rejection from the body, rather just broken fellowship, and the restoration therin. 
  
''Red Zone''

Run on sentence!  Verse 3-5 really demonstrate how excited Peter is about this idea.  And after following Christ for 3-4 decades you would expect that.  According to his abundant mercy he has "caused us to be born" into a living hope.  The idea that we have been caused to be born into a new an growing, and thriving hope, as we grow older the hope becomes larger and greater.  This can be a way to show christian maturity, in fact older christians often have the greatest hope towards the future, their living hope has grown all their life as they look forward to the heaven discussed in the following verses.  

Verse 8:  This joy isn't like a normal joy, the joy when your favorite team wins, like when your research actually works, like when you have a sucess.  The joy mentioned here is one of distinct spiritual roots, somehting that can only come from God. To be honest, I can't say that it's continual for me, but it is something I have experienced and it's pretty amazing.  I had a dicussion with Scott Womer once about the idea of Worship and one of the things we talked about is the fact that music, art, poetry and the like really function to help us with the inexpressible'ness of God's attributes and our responses to them.  Words don't always do justice to the idea, it's "inexpressible" because we can't tie it down to petty phrases, or easily understood outlines.  It requires something more, something deeper and more beautiful.  

''Green Zone:''

Trials, everyone gets them no body likes them... Kinda like the (insert least favorite food) of the faith.  They come up almost as much for other people as for us.  They often function as the best time to talk to people about their faith (or lack thereof).  One of the interesting points of section 6-7, is that it's directly counterpoint to the the gloriousness of the coming salvation.  Because we are strangers and sojourers in this land, Ed called us resident aliens, we're here, but we dont' exactly belong, we have friends, we work, we go to school, but we're just not like the others.  This is only of the hardest things about the christian life beacuse like it or not, the closer we get to christ, the more "sanctified" we become the more different we are.  This is (often) the cause of our trials.  We should be living life just different from other people.  Not only that, we'll often get extra trials due to the devil (he's real and has an aweful plan for your life) and finally, according to verse 6 we'll probably get extra trials from God.  

This sounds kinda like it sucks, and in a way, it really does.  When I worked at a camp for a couple of summers, one of the standard "jokes" was to get the new counselors to pray for patience, because sure enough, the next week the'd get it.  It was hilarious.  ADHD, develmentally disabled, punk rockers, etc.  They got patience quickly.   And you may be thinking that this passage would go better in the red zone, internal.  But my experience says that if you're in one of these times, you really don't realize it. Mostly you need someone else to tell you and encourage you, and live with you through the hard times.  And moreso, this kind of thing will happen to non-christians and this can be one of the best times to reach them because they are begining to see where CHristians have hope and they have none.
