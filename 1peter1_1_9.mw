The very first bible Study!

Weekly Questions:

Think about your personal perspective, examine your influences, be prepared to discuss an example of how you see things different than other people.

TBA when I finish the study, or at least mostly



''Prerequisites:''

As this is the first bible study that I'll be giving to this group and Becci and I are also new to the group, I think it is important to give a little bit of a background on myself so that they'll know a little more about where we're coming from.

''About us:''

I grew up (mostly) in Tillamook, OR; which is about 1.5 hours west from Portland, about 10 minutes from the mountains or the beach. I grew up spending lots of time outdoors, playing sports, exploring, as well as lots of time in the books. I have two loving christian parents, both of which have degrees in various sciences, geology, ichthelology, biology, etc.  I have 2 brothers, one older and one younger.  My other brother is married to a Ukrainian girl he met in the peace corp and just moved to DC to take a job with the state department and my younger brother is studying music education back in oregon.
  
I went to LeTourneau University, where I recieved a double degree in Mechanical and Materials Joining engineering.  However, more importantly, I lived in one of the most amazing communities I've ever seen.  I spent lots of time in study, working along others, and slaving in the lab.  Those who have recieved an engineering degree with honors understand the baptismal of flames they must undergo in order to finish.  I consider myself a pragmatic intellectual, and I value diligence, conservation, and community.  

My (actual) relationship with Christ started in Highschool while I was working at a christian camp, and have followed Him ever since, I've been through various phases of, I've read lots of books, I've studied lots of things, and I've been many places.  I don't say this to boast, but merely to give you a taste of me.  Perspective is important, it colors our viewpoint on things, it influences our decisions, flavors our understading, and it's important to remember that.  

I met Becci at LeTourneau and we started dating within a semester or meeting.  We were married (barely, I almost got stuck in Africa) May 30 2008, and what can I say.. being married is awesome, hard, but awesome.

Oh.. side note, I absolutely love culture references, don't know why.. just do.. you get extra points if you catch them, the points are not redeemable for anything, sorry.

''Perspective''

There is a song by a band (one of my favorites) called Five Iron Frenzy called Dandelion, it goes a little like this:

In a field of yellow flowers, 
underneath the sun, 
bluest eyes that spark with lightning, 
boy with shoes undone. 
He is young, so full of hope, 
reveling in tiny dreams, 
filling up, his arms with flowers, 
right for giving any queen. 

Running to her beaming bright, 
while cradling his prize. 
A flickering of yellow light, 
within his mother's eyes. 
She holds them to her heart, 
keeping them where they'll be safe, 
clasped within her very marrow, 
dandelions in a vase. 

She sees love, where anyone else would see weeds. 
all hope is found.
Here is everything he needs. 

I find that much of life is colored by our perspective on it, a simple event can be looked at so many ways it's mind boggling.  And this means that it's important to know where we come from so that we can understand why and how we see things.  The initial readers/writers of the Gospel knew this and when the scriptures were written they were written for a specific group of people, often for a specfic purpose, and we would do well to remember that.  Something I will try to do as this study continues, is to give you a bit of a picture of the people this letter was written to, as well as the writers perspective.  It's very easy to make snap judgements and even easier to come to false conclusions if we are not careful with our perspectives on things.  For example, Mormons often use the same vocabulary as Christians, but with a totally different dictionary, and so in a conversation you may end up convincing a Mormon that you believe they are correct!  Thusly,be cognizent of perspectives, because it's so easy to gloss over things because they were written to people who worked, and played, and lived 2000 years ago.  Don't be so quick to dismiss things, it's in the bible because it's important.

''"Theology"''

Begin crushing talk on extraordinarily difficult topic.  In my case this will be using power supply control to manipulate welding for different materials.  Hopefully there will be graphs and equations and greek letters and all of that nasty stuff.  The goal will be to completely confuse them, while at the same time providing a brief lecture that a materials joining/materials engineer could easily understand.  

Did anyone understand what I was saying?  Anyone?  Hmmm.. funny, it was all very clear I thought, and so did the person I ran it by at school...  In fact I would even propose that it was elegant, beautiful and simple.  Heres the problem, none of you all had the necessary background to understand it, the basics weren't there.  The tools weren't in your tool box to piece together the various philisophical and scientific constructs that I just went through.  While you could weld without knowing what I just talked about (did you catch it was about welding?)  it would greatly add to your ability to fully understand my talk.  

Theology is kind of like that, it's not strictly neccesary for you to be a "christian,"(reference thief on the cross) to know very much theology.  But if you expect to grow very much, or be really able to dive into it, you'll need to put the time in to learn it.  Being able to knit together different theological constructs, think critically about sermons, question bible studies (like mine), and basically think for yourself is a valuable thing.  If you haven't noticed most of the new testament is about theology, there are practical sections, (james for instance) but in general, it's theological.  The reason is simple, if you really really grasp the theory, then you just need practice to master things.  It's like learning a sport, you first learn the technique and then you practice it.  The better you understand the technique from the outset the faster you will be able to master it.  We tend to be lazy about our theology in the united states, we like 4 steps to a better prayer life, or 6 steps to a better marriage, or the prayer of jabez, or a million other gimmicks.  But these are like treating the symptons, instead of treating the disease, we're broken, shattered, tired, lazy, and messed up people, the better grasp we get on who God is, who we are and the relation between us, the better we'll get at all of those symptoms.  This isn't to say that those gimmicks aren't useful, practicality is good, but it's not going to fix all of our problems.  Things that are worth having seldom come easy.  

The final note on theology is this: be humble.  People have been arguing, fighting (wars even) and dicussing theology for a very long time, and odds are people that are smarter and better read than you or I have come up with some good ideas.  Don't try to develop your theology in a vacuum, but do be critical.  Remember, much of theology is what people have learned by studying the bible, and while their results are probably pretty good, they are probably close ezekial's exclamations, "it was like, it was like, it looked like, etc"  That doesn't mean we can neglect it, nor does it mean we can reject it.  But there is room for thoughful discussion, and remember to be Humble.. please, for a while I was a non-humble theologian, and I've met plenty, and they're usualy jerks...
