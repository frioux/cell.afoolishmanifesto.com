The very first bible Study!

Weekly Questions:

Think about your personal perspective, examine your influences, be prepared to discuss an example of how you see things different than other people.

TBA when I finish the study, or at least mostly



''Prerequisites:''

As this is the first bible study that I'll be giving to this group and Becci and I are also new to the group, I think it is important to give a little bit of a background on myself so that they'll know a little more about where we're coming from.

''About us:''

I grew up (mostly) in Tillamook, OR; which is about 1.5 hours west from Portland, about 10 minutes from the mountains or the beach. I grew up spending lots of time outdoors, playing sports, exploring, as well as lots of time in the books. I have two loving christian parents, both of which have degrees in various sciences, geology, ichthelology, biology, etc.  I have 2 brothers, one older and one younger.  My other brother is married to a Ukrainian girl he met in the peace corp and just moved to DC to take a job with the state department and my younger brother is studying music education back in oregon.
  
I went to LeTourneau University, where I recieved a double degree in Mechanical and Materials Joining engineering.  However, more importantly, I lived in one of the most amazing communities I've ever seen.  I spent lots of time in study, working along others, and slaving in the lab.  Those who have recieved an engineering degree with honors understand the baptismal of flames they must undergo in order to finish.  I consider myself a pragmatic intellectual, and I value diligence, conservation, and community.  

My (actual) relationship with Christ started in Highschool while I was working at a christian camp, and have followed Him ever since, I've been through various phases of, I've read lots of books, I've studied lots of things, and I've been many places.  I don't say this to boast, but merely to give you a taste of me.  Perspective is important, it colors our viewpoint on things, it influences our decisions, flavors our understading, and it's important to remember that.  

I met Becci at LeTourneau and we started dating within a semester or meeting.  We were married (barely, I almost got stuck in Africa) May 30 2008, and what can I say.. being married is awesome, hard, but awesome.

Oh.. side note, I absolutely love culture references, don't know why.. just do.. you get extra points if you catch them, the points are not redeemable for anything, sorry.

''Perspective''

There is a song by a band (one of my favorites) called Five Iron Frenzy called Dandelion, it goes a little like this:

In a field of yellow flowers, 
underneath the sun, 
bluest eyes that spark with lightning, 
boy with shoes undone. 
He is young, so full of hope, 
reveling in tiny dreams, 
filling up, his arms with flowers, 
right for giving any queen. 

Running to her beaming bright, 
while cradling his prize. 
A flickering of yellow light, 
within his mother's eyes. 
She holds them to her heart, 
keeping them where they'll be safe, 
clasped within her very marrow, 
dandelions in a vase. 

She sees love, where anyone else would see weeds. 
all hope is found.
Here is everything he needs. 

I find that much of life is colored by our perspective on it, a simple event can be looked at so many ways it's mind boggling.  And this means that it's important to know where we come from so that we can understand why and how we see things.  The initial readers/writers of the Gospel knew this and when the scriptures were written they were written for a specific group of people, often for a specfic purpose, and we would do well to remember that.  Something I will try to do as this study continues, is to give you a bit of a picture of the people this letter was written to, as well as the writers perspective.  It's very easy to make snap judgements and even easier to come to false conclusions if we are not careful with our perspectives on things.  For example, Mormons often use the same vocabulary as Christians, but with a totally different dictionary, and so in a conversation you may end up convincing a Mormon that you believe they are correct!  Thusly,be cognizent of perspectives, because it's so easy to gloss over things because they were written to people who worked, and played, and lived 2000 years ago.  Don't be so quick to dismiss things, it's in the bible because it's important.
