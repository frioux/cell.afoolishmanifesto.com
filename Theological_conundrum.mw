Becci and I just came across a philisophical/theological conundrum, it wasn't in our new tribe but rather a friend from back home, however, I figured this would be the best place to talk it over with some smart mature christians.  We thought the outcome of the discussion may have relevance in more than this particular situation.  The situation is as follows:

A christian friend of moderate maturity is involved in a dating relationship with a non-christian, while the non-christian is not antagonistic towards the faith they are obviously not bound by the same moral code and at some point they sleep together.  Afterwards this christian is consoled by the rationalization that they will get married and "in retrospect" they were going to get married anyways.  

Now, I make no attempt to justify or condone any of these actions, but if I was asked for advice in this particular issue I am struggling with what I perceive as two conflicting view points.  First off, generally dating/marrying a non-believer is a poor decision for all kinds of reasons and generally I would advise people against continuing a relationship that causes them to sin.  However, in this case they have had sexual relations and the bible is also pretty clear that that is no small bond between two people.  

So I guess my questions is what now, I'm not seeing a good easy resolution for this situation, as  friend I don't want to see a friend enter into a marriage with a non-believer that could potentially be a terrible decision, but I also don't want to belittle the gravity of the bond they now share.   Thoughts?

That is a tough situation, Goat. My initial thought is that their "bond" shouldn't be too much of a factor in determining their decisions about the future... sounds like there's good reason to not move forward in the relationship. But I'm definitely not a relationship expert. I'll pray for wisdom and grace for you as you interact with them.
